I've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.\n\nAnd I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.\n\nFor example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.\n\nWell, the passion started to heat up, but then she said \"I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.\"\n\nI said \"WHAT??!! What was that?!\"\n\nSo she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...\"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.\"\n\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, \"Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?\"\n\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\n\nThe very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.\n\nLet me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, \"That's fine, honey.\"\n\nShe appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, \"I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.\"\n\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, \"No honey, I don't feel like it.\"\n\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, \"WHAT?\"\n\nI then said \"Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.\n\nYou're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.\"\n\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, \"Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?\"\n\nApparently, no sex tonight either!\n\n\n\nEdit: Didn't expect to make front page but glad lots of you got a laugh out of it!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold!"

      "full_joke": "The Girlfriend Joke So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. \n\nBeing the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?\" \n\nAnd keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. \n\nSo I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, *\"Uh... No thanks, I'm good.\"* \n\n\"Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.\"\n\nSo a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, \"Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.\"\n\nSo I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, \"OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.\"\n\nSo I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.\n\nA couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?\" Luckily, she says, \"Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't  miss it.\"\n\nSo I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled \"*Video Games*.\" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, \"Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?\" and she responds with, \"No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it.\" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.\n\nSo I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.\n\nSo a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.\" \n\nI tell her, \"Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great.\" She says, \"Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow\n\nSo next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.\" \n\n\"Wait, what? Why not? What happened?\"\n\n\"Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.\"\n\n\"I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person\"\n\n\"She told me, and I quote, that she is going to *fucking murder me*.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.\"\n\nI go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.\n\nSo day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.\n\nThen I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, \"She's dead, you're next.\" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.\n\nNow I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE. \n\nAnd it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?"

      "full_joke": "A man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n\nEDIT: if you liked this joke, go to r/feghoot for more like this one!\n\nEDIT 2: To people screaming repost, i gave credit to  u/insolent_swine in the comments.

Those were kind of her fetishes, and she didn't know why. She didn't really like to use condoms, though, which was very dumb of her, and she knew that, but she thought it felt so much better without one. Also, she was on birth control.\n\nOnly, one day, her period didn't come as expected. She thought it was probably nothing, but she was suspicious nonetheless. She went to the store and bought a pregnancy test, and, lo and behold, she was indeed pregnant. Well, shit. Due to her active sex life and having slept with all those prisoners and frat boys, she didn't really know, which one of them had gotten her pregnant. She thought about what she was to do. Should she keep the baby? How could she find the father? And then it hit her.\n\nShe had to make a list of all the bros and cons."

There was a huge outcry from the Muslim community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.\n\nThe Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti didn't speak Italian, and the Pope didn't speak Arabic, they agreed that it would be a \"silent\" debate.\n\nOn the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his fingers around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy.\n\nLater the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God! Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won. \"I haven't a clue,\" the Mufti said. \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him as they call it 'the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!\" \"And then what?\" asked a woman. \"Who knows?\" said the Mufti. \"He took out his lunch so I took out mine.\"\n\nEdit: First time I heard this joke was around a year ago, but I had never heard the Jewish one until shortly after. So yeah, I'm well aware it's a repost, but, obviously by the votes, not that many people heard it the first time around (or second, third...fifth...twenty-second...etc.) so thank you, but it has already been pointed out."

Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.\n\n\"So, you're a politician...\"\n\"Well, yes, is that a problem?\"\n\"Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!\" \n\n\"Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??\" says the politician.\n\"Them's the rules\" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...\n\nAnd awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?\n\n\"Open your eyes!\" says a voice. \"C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!\". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini.\n\"Who are you??\" The politician asks. \"Well, I'm Satan!\" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. \"Welcome to Hell!\"\n\"Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?\" he asks.\nSatan throws him a wink. \"Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\"\nSlightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course.\n\"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question.\nSo they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...\n\nAnd is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\"\n\"No sir!\" says the man.\n\"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\".\n\"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician.\n\"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.\n\nThe man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.\n\"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???\"\n\n\"Ah\", says Satan. \"You see, yesterday, we were campaigning.

I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Hindus or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae."

His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes as she asked \"What was the 1-2-3 for?\"  \nAnd that, boys and girls, is why we should never end our sentences with a preposition, because we could end up with a dangling participle."

The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia, so for the terrible crime of actually being caught consuming the booze, they are all sentenced to death! \n\nHowever, after many months and with the help of very good lawyers, they were able to successfully appeal their sentences down to life imprisonment. By a stroke of luck, it was a Saudi national holiday the day their trial finished, and the extremely benevolent Sheikh decided they could be released after receiving just 20 lashes each of the whip. \n\nAs they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheikh announced: \"It's my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping. \n\nThe German was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: \"Please tie a pillow to my back.

      "full_joke": "Socrates the philosopher . . . Keep this in mind the next time you are about to repeat a rumor or spread gossip. \n\nIn ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, \"Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Socrates replied, \"Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.\"\n\n\"Triple filter?\" asked the acquaintance.\n\n\"That's right,\" Socrates continued, \"Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?\"\n\n\"No,\" the man said, \"Actually I just heard about it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Socrates, \"So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?\"\n\n\"No, on the contrary...\"\n\n\"So,\" Socrates continued, \"You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?\"\n\nThe man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, \"You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?\"\n\n\"No, not really.\"\n\n\"Well,\" concluded Socrates, \"If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?\"\n\nThe man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.\n\nIt also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife."

Randy runs out of the hen house and sees a flock of geese down by the lake ~WHAM~ he gets all the geese. Randy's up in the pigpen. He's in with the cows. Randy is jumping on every animal the farmer owns.\n\nThe farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't even last the day. Sure enough, the farmer goes to bed and wakes up the next day to find Randy dead as a doorknob in the middle of the yard. Buzzards are circling overhead.\n\nThe farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful animal, shakes his head and says, \"Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to yourself.\"  Randy opens one eye, nods towards the sky and says, \"Shhh. They're getting closer...\"\n\n\n**Well worth the read**\n\n**EDIT**: Since this hit front page I must credit my friend. He text this to me while I was at work and I put it on here.

The counter clerk turns to the woman and asks her what she would like. \n\n“Oh, nothing for me, deary. My husband and I share everything.'” \n\nThe clerk hits a key on the register and tells the couple that the cost of the meal is $4.98. \n\nThe old man reaches into his pockets and pulls out a handful of coins. Slowly and carefully, without a penny to spare, he counts out the exact amount and hands it to the cashier.\n\nA young man standing behind the couple watches this. As the clerk assembles the couple’s order, he leans forward and says, “I’d be honored to buy you another burger and fries.”\n\nThe old man turns to the young man and says, “Thank you, but my wife and I share everything.” \n\nThe old man carries the tray of food to a table and they sit. Carefully, he cuts the burger in half, divides the fries into two equal portions, and passes half of the food to the woman. He sets the decaf in the center of the table so they can both reach it. Then he begins to eat.  \n\nA few minutes later, the young man sits down at the table next to them. As he gobbles down his food, he notices that, while the elderly man eats, the woman is quietly sipping decaf. When he looks at her food, he sees that she hasn’t eaten a single bite. Again, he leans toward the couple and says, “I really would be honored to buy you another meal.'”\n\nThe old man says, “No, thank you. We share everything,” and calmly resumes eating.\n\n“I just hate to see you go hungry,” the young man laments to the woman.\n\n“Oh, I’m not going hungry,” the old woman says. “I’m waiting for the teeth.”"

Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1 000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. \n\nThe next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero. \n\nUpon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get Lost. The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the kings underwear. The king immediately summoned Nick."

Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. \n\nHe looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean. \n\nSo was the rest of the house. He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.\n\nThen he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: \n\n\"Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get\ngroceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight.

When they reach the Pearly Gates, St. Peter greets them, giving them the usual speel that everyone gets when they're about to enter, and as they are walking in he says \" By the way, I almost forgot the new rule. Whatever you do, don't step on a duck.\"  The three friends think this is an odd rule, but they agree to it and step in. \n\nThe second they enter they realize that the final rule might be harder to follow than they thought. Heaven is TEEMING with ducks!  Try as they might, they quickly realize that avoiding the birds is going to be a difficult task. And then it happens, \"QUACK!\"  Friends Two and Three look over in shock as Friend One steps on a duck. Quickly, an angel rushes over with one of the most unattractive people the three of them have ever seen. \"Because you stepped on a duck, you are condemned to spend the rest of you time in the Kingdom shackled to this person. Have a good eternity.\"  The angel shackles the two together and flies off. \n\nAfter seeing what happened to Friend One, the other two are more wary of the consequences and begin treading extremely lightly. The two of them make it another three days before, on the dawn of the fourth day, a loud \"QUACK\" is heard. Friend Two looks to Friend Three, wide-eyed, fearing the worst. The angel rushes over, ties Friend Two to a hideous being, and flies away. \n\nThe third friend, now petrified that this will be his fate, becomes incredibly paranoid, barely walking anywhere. He lasts one week, two weeks, but on the beginning of the third week an angel brings one of the most stunningly beautiful people the friend has ever seen, shackles the two of them together, and flies off. Bewildered and excited, Friend Three proclaims, \"Wow!  What did I do to deserve this?\"  And the person the friend is shackled to turns and replies \"I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!"

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone \"Happy Birthday.\"\nI thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids...

All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don’t even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.\n\nThen we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training.

I’m about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake . I only beat him once.

However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks.\n The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter. After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before!\n All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty! One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, \"Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.\"\n \"My darling,\" he replied, \"Think nothing of it. I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek."

She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan.\n \nThe bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there.\n \nTwo weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, \"Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?\" The blond replies.....\"Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"

What was that?!”\n\nSo she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear…\n“You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me\nto satisfy your physical needs as a man”.\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?”\n\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\n\nThe very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store.\nI walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits.\nShe couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.\nLet me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.\nI started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey”.\nShe was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.\nSmiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all\ndear, let’s go to the cashier”.\n\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel\nlike it”.\n\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled\n\"WHAT?”.\n\nI then said “honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”.\n\nApparently I’m not having sex tonight either."

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.\n\nFinally, the son said, \"Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.\"\n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, \"If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.\"\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.\n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.\n\n\"Father,\" replied the son, \"I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, \"If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.\"\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\n\n\"Father,\" said the son to this, \"I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. \"A carton of pink ping pong balls?\"\n\n\"A carton of pink ping pong balls,\" the boy confirmed.\n\n\"I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,\" said the father, \"but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.\" And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n\n\"Dear son,\" said the father, \"I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. \"Please humour me, dear father.\"\n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \"Dearest father,\" the son started, \"I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.\" One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.\n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n\n\"Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.\" It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\n\n\"Father,\" the son said, \"You've made me very happy yet again.\" That night, the son spent on board the tanker.\n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. \"My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?\"\n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. \"Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. \"Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.\"\n\n\"Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\n\n\"Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe son nodded weakly.\n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.\n\n\"Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,\" the father requested.\n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\n\n\"I-\" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n\n\"I- I-\"\n\nThen he died."

Just as they reached the first tee, a beautiful young blond woman carrying her bag of clubs approached them.\n\nShe explained that the member who brought her to the club for a round of golf had an emergency that called him away and asked the trio whether she could join them.\n\nNaturally, the guys all agreed.\n\nSmiling, the blonde thanked them and said, 'Look, fellows, I work in a topless bar as a dancer, so nothing shocks me anymore. If any of you want to smoke cigars, have a beer, bet, swear, tell off-color stories or do anything that you normally do when playing a round together, go ahead. But, I enjoy playing golf, consider myself pretty good at it, so don't try to coach me on how to play my shots.'\n\nWith that the guys agreed to relax and invited her to drive first.\n\nAll eyes were fastened on her shapely behind as she bent to place her ball on the tee. She then took her driver and hit the ball 270 yards down the middle, right in front of the green.\n\nThe father's mouth was agape. 'That was beautiful,' he said.\n\nThe blonde put her driver away and said, 'I really didn't get into it, and I faded it a little.'\n\nAfter the three guys hit their drives and their second shots, the blonde took out an eight iron and lofted the ball within five feet of the hole. (She was closest to the pin.)\n\nThe son said, 'Damn, lady, you played that perfectly.'\n\nThe blonde frowned and said, 'It was a little weak, but even an easy seven would have been too much club. I've left a tricky little putt.' She then tapped in the five-footer for a birdie.\n\nHaving the honors, she drove first on the second hole, knocked the heck out of the ball, and it landed nearly 300 yards away smack in the middle of the fairway.\n\nFor the rest of the round the statuesque blonde continued to amaze the guys, quietly and methodically shooting for par or less on every hole.\n\nWhen they arrived at the 18th green, the blond was three under par, and had a very nasty \n12-foot putt on an undulating green for a par.\n\nShe turned to the three guys and said, 'I really want to thank you all for not acting like a bunch of chauvinists and telling me what club to use or how to play a shot, but I need this putt for a 69 and I'd really like to break 70 on this course.\n\nIf any one of you can tell me how to make par on this hole I'll take him back to my apartment, pour some 35-year-old Single Malt Strath Mill Scotch in him, fix him a steak dinner and then show him a very good time the rest of the night.'\n\nThe yuppie son jumped at the thought! He strolled across the green, carefully eyeing the line of the putt and finally said, 'Honey, aim about 6 inches to the right of the hole and hit it firm. It will get over that little hump and break right into the cup.'\n\nThe father knelt down and sighted the putt using his putter as a plumb. 'Don't listen to the kid, darlin', you want to hit it softly 10 inches to the right and let it run left down that little hogback, so it falls into the cup.'\n\nThe old gray-haired grandfather walked over to the blonde's ball, picked it up and handed it to her and said, 'That's a gimme, sweetheart.' The blonde smiled and said, 'Your car or mine?'"

I walked back home to get my husband's help.\n\nWhen I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbours daughter.

Start by checking that there is no dirt in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nWalter."

Then, when they were only partway through the job, they determined that they did not, after all, have enough paint to complete the job. Not wishing to spend any more money if they didn't absolutely have to, they decided they would just dilute the water-based paint they were using so that it would last longer. They did this a couple more times before they finished, which caused striping on the church as the paint got lighter eachtime it was thinned. The painters had just about gotten to the top of thesteeple, when, all of a sudden, the sky darkened, and the rain started to pour down. \n\nAs the paint streamed down the sides of the church, a voice boomed from the heavens: \"Repaint, you thinners! Repaint, and thin no more!"

Airman Jones was assigned to the induction center, where he advised new recruits about their government benefits, especially their GI insurance.\n\n\nIt wasn't long before Captain Smith noticed that Airman Jones had almost a 100% record for insurance sales, which had never happened before.\n\n\nRather than ask about this, the Captain stood in the back of the room and listened to Jones's sales pitch.\n\n\nJones explained the basics of the GI Insurance to the new recruits, and then said: \"If you have GI Insurance and go into battle and are killed, the government has to pay $200,000 to your beneficiaries.\n\n\nIf you don't have GI insurance, and you go into battle and get killed, the government only has to pay a maximum of $6000.\"\n\"Now,\" he concluded, \"which bunch do you think they are going to send into battle first?\"\n\n---\n\nRussian President Putin called President George W.

When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.\n\n\nAt the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.\n\n\n\"All this was just too wonderful for words,\" he said, \"but what's the dollar for?\" \"Well,\" she said, \"last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you.\" He said, \"Screw him, give him a dollar.\" The lady then said, \"The breakfast was my idea.\"\n\n---\n\nA lady goes to her parish priest one day and tells him, \"Father, I have a problem.

I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop saying that...that phrase in no time.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" the lady responded, \"this may very well be the solution.\"\n\n\nThe next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.\n\n\nAfter just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out in unison, \"Hi, we're prostitutes.

He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.\n\n\nHe goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. \"Goodness,\" says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.\n\n\nUpon awaking, the little guy says, \"Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.\"\n\n\nThe man says, \"I can't take anything from you, I\"m just glad I didn\"t hurt you too badly,\" and walks away.\n\n\nWatching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, \"Well, he was a nice enough guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I'll give him the three things that I would want. I'll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.\"\n\n\nWell, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.\n\n\nThe leprechaun says, \"I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?\"\n\n\nThe golfer says, \"It's great! I hit under par every time.\"\n\n\nThe leprechaun says, \"I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?\"\n\n\nThe golfer says, \"Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.\"\n\n\nThe leprechaun smiles and says, \"I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?\"\n\n\nThe golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, \"Well, maybe once or twice a week.\"\n\n\nThe leprechaun is floored and stammers, \"Once or twice a week?!\"\n\n\nThe golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, \"Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.\"\n\n---\n\nTwo lawyers walking through the woods spotted a vicious looking bear.\n\n\nThe first lawyer immediately opened his briefcase, pulled out a pair of sneakers and started putting them on.\n\n\nThe second lawyer looked at him and said, \"You're crazy!

The top was down, the breeze was blowing through what was left of his hair and he decided to open her up. As the needle jumped up to 80 mph he suddenly saw a flashing red and blue light behind him.\n\n\n\"There ain't no way they can catch a Corvette,\" he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, 100, 130 and finally 150 with the light still behind him. \"What the hell am I doing?\" he thought and pulled over.\n\n\nThe cop came up to him, took his license without a word and examined it and the car. \"I've had a tough shift and this is my last pull over. I don't feel like more paperwork so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before you can go!\"\n\n\n\"Last week my wife ran off with a cop,\" the man said, \"and I was afraid you were trying to give her back!\"\n\n\n\"Off you go,\" said the officer.\n\n---\n\nA driver is pulled over by a police man.\n\n\nMan: Is there a problem Officer?\n\n\nOfficer: Sir, you were speeding.\n\n\nMan: Oh I see.\n\n\nOfficer: Can I see your licence please?\n\n\nMan: I'd give it to you but I don't have one.\n\n\nOfficer: Don't have one?\n\n\nMan: Lost it four times for drink driving.\n\n\nOfficer: I see, can I see your vehicle registration papers please?\n\n\nMan: I can't do that.\n\n\nOfficer: Why not?\n\n\nMan: I stole this car.\n\n\nOfficer: Stole it?\n\n\nMan: Yes, and I raped and killed the owner.\n\n\nOfficer: You what?\n\n\nMan: She's in the boot if you want to see.\n\n\nThe Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes five police cars circle the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.\n\n\nOfficer #2: Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please! The man steps out of his vehicle.\n\n\nMan: Is there a problem sir?\n\n\nOfficer #2: One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.\n\n\nMan: Murdered the owner?\n\n\nOfficer #2: Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please.\n\n\nThe man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.\n\n\nOfficer #2: Is this your car sir?\n\n\nMan: Yes, here are the registration papers.\n\n\nThe officer is quite stunned.\n\n\nOfficer #2: One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.\n\n\nThe man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled.\n\n\nOfficer #2: Thank you sir, one of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, raped and murdered the owner.\n\n\nMan: I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too.\n\n---\n\nAn exhausted hunter out in the woods stumbled across another hunter.\n\n\nHunter #1: \"Am I glad to see you, I've been lost for three days.\"\n\n\nHunter #2: \"Don't get too excited, friend, I've been lost for three weeks.\"\n\n---\n\nAfter a 2 year study, the National Science Foundation announced the following results on America's ball-related recreational preferences:\n\n\n1.

The teacher tells the principal that she has had it with his exaggerations. The principal tells her to send Johnny to him the next time he shows up late. He will tell Johnny a lie so big that he will never tell another one. Ever.\n\n\nThe next day, Johnny shows up two hours late. Johnny says, \"I was two hours early today so I had time to fish in the pond on my way to school. I caught a 17-pound trout and had to take it home. If I didn't clean it and freeze it, my mom would've been angry. That's why I'm so late\".\n\n\nThe teacher promptly takes him to the principal's office and explains the story to the principal.\n\n\nThe principal tells Johnny about his own trip to school that day. He says, \"I was walking to school through the park on the trail today when I heard something behind me. I turned around and was shocked to see a giant grizzly bear behind me. He was 24 feet tall and had 6-inch fangs. He was going to eat me, Johnny! Just then a little dog ran out from the bushes, jumped up and attacked the bear. The little dog killed the bear and then ate the whole bear right there in front of me. What do you think of that, Johnny?\"\n\n\nJohnny replies, \"Oh yeah, that's my dog Sparky. That's his third bear this week.\"\n\n---\n\nA man decides to take the opportunity while his wife is away to paint the toilet seat.

There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense’s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick.\n\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,\" the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. \"Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom.\"\nHe looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened.\n\n\nFinally the lawyer said, \"Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.\"\n\n\nThe jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.\n\n\n\"But how?\" inquired the lawyer. \"You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.\"\nAnswered the jury foreman: \"Oh, we did look. But your client didn’t.\"\n\n---\n\nA young woman, with a baby in her arms, entered a butcher shop and confronted the butcher with the news that the baby was his and asked what he was going to do about it?\n\n\nHe said he'd offer to provide her with free meat until the boy was 16. She agreed.\n\n\nThe butcher had been counting the years off on his calendar, and one day the teenager who had been collecting the meat each week, came into the shop and said, \"I'll be 16 tomorrow.\" \"I know,\" said the butcher with a smile, \"I've been counting too, tell your mother, when you take this parcel of meat home, that it is the last free meat she'll get, and watch the expression on her face.\" When the boy arrived home he told his mother.\n\n\nThe woman nodded and said, \"Son, go back to the butcher and tell him I have also had free bread, free milk, and free groceries for the last 16 years and watch the expression on his face!\"\n\n---\n\nThe young bride approached her awaiting husband on their wedding night and demanded $20 for their first love-making encounter. In his highly aroused state, he readily agreed.\n\n\nThis scenario was repeated each time they made love for the next 30 years, him thinking it was a cute way for her to buy new clothes, etc.\n\n\nArriving home around noon one day, she found her husband in a very drunken state. Over the next few minutes she heard of the ravages of financial ruin caused by corporate down sizing and it's effects on a 50 year old executive.\n\n\nCalmly, she handed him a bank book showing deposits and interest for 12 years totaling nearly $1 million dollars. Pointing across the parking lot she gestured toward the local bank while handing him stock certificates worth nearly $2 million dollars and informing him that he was the largest stockholder in the bank. She told him that for 30 years she had charged him each time they had sex , and this was the result of her investments.\n\n\nBy now he was distraught and beating his head against the side of the car.

The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car.\n\n\nThe wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car.

He gets greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place. The Mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.\n\n\nThe hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. The deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the Mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.\n\n\nThe Mafia hood says to the interpreter, \"Ask him where da money is.\"\n\n\nThe interpreter signs, \"Where's the money?\"\n\n\nThe dumb man signs back, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\nThe interpreter tells the hood, \"He says he doesn't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\nThe hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the dumb collector. \"Now ask him where the money is!\"\n\n\nThe interpreter signs, \"Where is the money?\n\n\nThe deaf man signs back, \"The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park.\"\n\n\nThe interpreter says to the hood, \"He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger.\"\n\n---\n\nSo, Donald Rumsfeld is briefing George Bush in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\"Oh and finally, sir, three Brazilian soldiers were killed in Iraq today.\"\n\n\nBush goes pale, his jaw hanging open in stunned disbelief.

The boss says to his subordinate, \"I'm going to take a ride up there in the cart and ask if we can play through.\"\n\nThe boss gets about 50 yards from the green and abruptly turns around and drives back to the tee.  The subordinate asks, \"What happened?  Why didn't you say anything to them?\"\n\nThe boss says, \"I got about 50-60 yards away, and I could tell that the two women were my wife and my mistress.\"\n\nThe subordinate says, \"We ain't got all day.  Let me go talk with them.\"  So he drives up, gets about 50 yards away, and abruptly turns around.\n\nWhen he gets back to the tee, he says, \"Unbelievable.  What a fucking coincidence."

He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you.

He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. \"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\" The monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."

Do you think I could stay the night?\"\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a beautiful sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\n\nYears later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\n\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.\n\nFinally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\n\nThe man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!\nWith trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."

      "full_joke": "So Satan asks God to let him back into Heaven... God says \"Satan, you've betrayed me before, but I am a just and forgiving god. You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest.\"\n\nSatan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. \n\nEaster Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. \n\nOne hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. \n\nBy 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. \n\nBy noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. \n\nAt 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. \n\nBy 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. \n\n2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces \"JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!\" \n\nSatan is furious. \"How can this be?\" He asks. \"I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!\"\n\nJesus taunts Satan. \"Well I don't see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off.\"\n\n\"Your computer was shut off, too!\" Satan retorts. \"I guess neither of us win!\" \n\nGod, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan's coding cannot be found, but when Jesus's computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. \n\n\"How can this be?\" Satan snarls. \"I finished more coding! It should be there! I should've won this!\" \n\n\"Satan, my friend,\" God says, \"You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... \n\nJesus saves."

She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, \"Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found out that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?\" The blond replies.....\"Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"

One day for his sixth birthday his parents decided to take him to the circus. Little Sam was so excited he could not stop bouncing in his seat in the car, nor could he stand still in line whilst his parents purchased their tickets.\n\n\nSam and his parents find their seats and wait for the circus to commence(the waiting nearly killed Sam). Finally the circus starts; the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, and finally towards the end of the show the clowns come out. This is what Sam has been waiting for all night (he loves to laugh).\n\n\nThe clowns go through their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, etc.. All of the clowns but one leave the center ring. This clown turns on a microphone he is given by the ring master and says, \"Ladies and Gentleman! For your last laugh of the evening I will need a volunteer!\" Little Sam, not knowing what this was all about, was the only one who did not raise his hand.\n\n\nThe Clown makes a spectacle of choosing his volunteer, and finally the spot light lands on little Sam. He looks to his parents questioningly and they wave him down. After he makes his way down the aisle and into the center ring.\n\n\nThe clown asks, \"What is your name little boy?\"\n\n\"S-sam.\" he replies.\n\n\"Well S-sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?\"\n\n\"N-no?\"\n\n\"Well little Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well you must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!\"\n\n\nThe crowd goes wild with laughter, rofl barely covers it. All the while this is happening little Sam is mortified to be laughed at by so many people and starts crying right there in the center ring which, much to his dismay, made everyone laugh all the harder. He makes his way back to his parents and they take him home all the way attempting to make him feel better.\n\n\n---~10 Years Later---\n\n\nLittle Sam is no longer so little, he is now a Sophmore in high-school. Albeit a little awkward, tonight he is taking out a girl for their very first date. Now this girl not only is completely out of his league, but she is a very popular girl. He has done his research and found out that she is dying to go see the circus.\n\n\nOn their way to the circus he is so excited he is almost bouncing in his seat, of course he doesn't because that would be completely uncool of him. As they are standing in line to get their tickets, he can hardly stand still, he is definitely hoping to get some hand holding action tonight!\n\n\nThey take their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills not so little Sam as he inches his hand ever closer to hers without making it obvious). Finally he touches his pinky finger to her pinky just as the lights go down and the circus starts, which also happens to be when everyone begins to applaud.\nHe cannot truly enjoy circus because the entire time he is still trying to touch her hand. He can tell by her reactions the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget being shot out of a cannon was exhilarating. Finally the clowns come out.\n\n\nThis is when Sam finally begins to pay attention, he is searching for a clown he has seen 10 years ago that scarred him.\n\n\n*NO SHIT!* - he thinks to himself - *THAT CAN'T BE THE SAME CLOWN!* (It was)\n\n\nThe clowns do their usual routine, pies to the face, falling down on purpose, hitting other clowns over the head. Towards the end of the act all of the clown leave the center ring except one. *The same fucking clown, god damn-it!*\n\n\nThe clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy for the evening I will need a volunteer!\"\n\n\n*Like hell I'm going to volunteer* Sam thinks to himself, yet in doing this he is the only person not raising his hand. The clown again makes a spectacle of choosing volunteer. Finally the spotlight stops on not so little Sam.\n\n\nWide-eyed Sam looks over to his date and she has a brilliant smile on her face and urges him to go down after a quick kiss on the cheek. After this moment Sam is in a daze *my first kiss, oh my god, it was amazing*. The next thing he knows he is standing before the clown in the center ring.\n\n\n\"What is your name young man?\"\n\n*I hope its not the same lame ass joke* \"My name is Sam.\"\n\n\"Well Sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?\"\n\n*Really? Again?* Reluctantly Sam says, \"No.\"\n\n\"Well Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?\"\n\n\"Ugh No.\"\n\n\"Well then Sam, you must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!\"\n\n\nThe crowd completely goes wild, rotflmfao barely covers it. He looks into the seats where he and his date were sitting and she is laughing just as hard as everyone else. For some reason that Sam cannot explain to this very day he broke down crying, this time in front of everyone and his date, which makes the crowd laugh even harder.\nThis day Sam swears his revenge on this god-awful clown.\n\n\n---~10 Years Later---\n\n\nBig Sam is now 26 years old with a family of his own; a wife of 5 years, two beautiful children, a dog, all that good shit.\n\n\nFor vacation Sam decides to take his family on a cruise ship. Big Sam is bouncing in his seat (he doesn't have to be cool anymore), his children are as well. As they wait to board the ship Sam can hardly stand still *Open Bar! Free Child Care! Free Massage!*. As he is handed a list of events from the person overseeing the boarding he notices there is even a circus on this cruise. *No way, what would the odds be?*\n\n\nThey enjoy their cruise, and on the last night Sam brings his family to the circus. They get their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills his children). The lights finally go down and it begins. The trapeze were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget getting shot out of a cannon was riveting, the motorcycles that go around in a sphere nearly took their breath away, finally the clowns come out.\n\n\n*Ok you mother fucking clown where are you at? Where, oh where can you--AHA!* Sam spots the clown that has caused him so much pain in the past which is great for him because he has come up with the perfect response to this clown.\n\n\nThe clowns do their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, hitting others over the head with hammers, spraying others with water jet flowers. Towards the end of the act all of the clowns except one leave the center ring.\n\n\n*Show time!*\n\n\nThe clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master.\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy tonight I will need a volunteer!\"\n\n*If I don't raise my hand you're going to pick me. I know your game clown!*\n\nAs usual big Sam is the only one that does not raise his hand. The clown makes a big spectacle of choosing his volunteer. Finally the spotlight lands on big Sam.\n\n\n*Now its my turn!*\n\n\nBefore he knows it Sam is down in front of the clown with a smug smile on his face.\n\n\n\"Well sir, what would your name be?\"\n\n\"My name would be Sam\", he replies with a confidence that makes the clown a little uneasy.\n\n\"Well Sam, are you the front-end of a jack-ass?\"\n\n\"No, not I am not the front-end of a jack-ass.\", he answers as smugly as he can manage. He is now bubbling with anticipation.\n\n\"Yes, well then, are you the back-end of a jack-ass?\"\n\n\"Ha no, no I am not.\"\n\n\"Well Sam, You must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!\"\n\n\nThe crowd goes wild, little old ladies have heart attacks, ICU hardly covers it.\nSam grabs the microphone from the clown, and the crowd immediately quiets down.\nSam looks the clown straight in the face and says, \"Fuck you."

Yes, things were tough during those times, when the people of that ravaged city had to band together to defend themselves and their neighbors. Years later, the priest and the rabbi would invite one another to family dinners, and over ample glasses of wine, as their children played in front of the fire, they would discuss the political events that led up to such vicious tragedies, thankful that they were able to survive and prosper.\n\nOf course, as time takes its toll, the pastor eventually passed away and the rabbi, very old, but still loving of his comrade, spoke at his funeral. It was a strange experience to see all the people gathered around him, whom the pastor had known, whom the rabbi now knew as well. He felt satisfied to be an old man with such a meaningful, long friendship that had opened up his family and included so many more, whom he may have never met if it weren't for that pastor.\n\nEventually ,the rabbi passed away, and his funeral was equally as attended, and both men's good will and spirit was passed down through the generations of their family. In reality, that conflict was just a blip in the course of human history; a long forgotten moment in time where tragedy, just for a second, reared its ugly head and grabbed hold of the human spirit. But the rabbi and the pastor's friendship was a testament to humanity's ability to find connections even in the worst of times. On Mars, eventually, the pastor's descendants would erect a statue of the two men, for their courage represented the tolerance and kindness of the new generation that had come forth after such a brutal conflict.\n\nWith the advent of the EM drive, humanity prospered and spread among the stars, with the rabbi and pastor's progeny being counted among the many brave explorers who discovered thousands of new worlds. Many of their children's children did not believe the same things as their forefathers, and in fact some did not believe at all, but they were still valued members of their community, and their family names lived on as respected icons of accomplishment."

One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would you like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\ntill the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\nhe jumped.\n\nSlowly at first,\n\nbut speeding up,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\nspeeding past Pluto,\n\nand the other outer planets,\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\nI'm a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI've been through many a hard ship in my life."

      "full_joke": "John owned the local florist shop. The shop had been in his family for five generations -- and he loved his work. He was a part of people’s lives, from their first prom, to valentines gifts, birthdays, weddings, and even funerals -- he loved his work, and the town loved him. Life for him, his wife Susan, his mom Louis, and their three kids John Jr (JJ), Alexis, and Peter was perfect.\n\nAll that changed though when one day, right across the street, a new shop opened: Holy Brothers Holy Flowers. Intrigued, he went over to introduce himself. Turns out two Friars had recently left their order to open a flower store. They were elderly gentleman who had spent decades tending the garden at their Friary, but ultimately wanted to go live in the outside world. John was friendly, and thought to himself “well, I’m sure this town can support two florists,” so we went back to his store and thought nothing more of it. \n\nBut as time went on more and more people started going to Holy Flowers. A rumor had gotten started that the flowers were blessed, and that you’d get good luck by going there. Sales dropped for John, money got tight, and he started to accrue debt. Finally, nobody came into his store at all any more.\n\nOne day, out of desperation, he went across the street to talk to the friars. He said “guys, I need you to move your store. My family has owned this place for five generations and I’m going to lose it.” The friars told him to fuck off.\n\nHe went home and told his wife. Thinking a womans touch might help, she went to talk to the friars. “My family is going to lose our home, please move to the next town over.” She was again told to fuck off.\n\nIn a moment of despair, they sent their children to go plead their case. JJ, Alexis, and Peter went to see the Friars. “Please sirs, or parents are losing everything, you have to help us out.” They too were told to fuck off.\n\nNext, John’s mother Louis, a kindly, persuasive, but tough woman went to talk to them. She was told to fuck off.\n\nSitting in his dusty empty store John contemplated his failings while he killed a bottle of cheap whiskey. His store, his future, he’s lost all of it. Sitting in a stupor, a thought drifted into his mind. He remembered an old family – acquaintance. He picked up the phone and called the man, a huge (probably former felon) guy named Hugh. Nobody knew exactly what Hugh did, but he wasn’t a good guy. John’s dad had done Hugh a favor once so they were in his good graces, but this was a man to be respected and feared. \n\nJohn explained the situation to Hugh over the phone, who simply said “I’ll deal with it” and hung up the phone. \n\nTwo days later Holy Flowers closed. No explanation, no closing sale, the just shut their doors, drove out of town as fast as they could, leaving everything behind. Customers started coming back to John, and he lived happily ever after.\n\nThe moral of the story? Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars."

      "full_joke": "Nate the Snake joke Warning, unhealthily long Tim was an adventurous man, and he had quite a bit of money. One afternoon during work, Tim decided that he wanted to go driving on the dunes in egypt. So that weekend, he booked tickets to Cairo and took a few extra days off work. When he arrived in Cairo he took a bus to a smaller village with less people and laxer laws and rented a car to drive on the dunes. He went out the first time at night around 11:30 because his flight came in late. \n\nTim had a marvelous time on the dunes: driving up and down them, going far too fast, and of course, drifting. He was at it all night and was having fun but the sky was getting brighter and he decided it was time to head home. As he started off towards the village the car suddenly sputtered and died and try as he might, Tim could not start it up again. Tim kept trying to start the car, he had extra gas so it wasn't that, what could it be? \n\nEventually Tim figured out the battery had died. This worried Tim slightly but he remembered the village was to the east so he figured he could walk. The car compass said the nose was pointing east so he took his water bottle from the car and started walking off in that direction. What Tim didn't know was that the compass wasn't accurate because the car had died so he ended up walking west instead of east. He walked for a few hours at which point he climbed to the top of a large dune to see if he could see the village. From the summit he looked and could only see the car several miles back where he came from and then nothing but desert for miles and miles around.\n\nTim decided it would be best to head back to the car and around mid day he made it back. He then decided it would be best to follow the car tracks. He followed and followed them along but ended up back at the car. Confused and frustrated, he thought how that could happen. He concluded that because he was doing donuts, he ended up following the wrong trail. He set out again determined to find the right one; an hour later he was back at the car. He tried one last time but the wind was covering the tire tracks with sand making traveling not possible and he was forced to return to the vehicle. Tim by this point was desperate. He decided his only option was to just pick a direction and hope for the best. He collected what little remained of his water and a bottle of wiper fluid he had in his car in case he needed fluids and picked a direction and started walking.\n\nBy the time Tim left the car it was pushing 6 o'clock. He walked and walked for several hours and ended up at the foot of a large sand dune. Tim decided that his best chance of survival was to climb the dune so he set out. About 45 feet up he was feeling the burn and pretty soon it became too steep to climb. Tim got on his hands and knees determined to climb the dune. About half way up he chugged the last of his water and continued to forge on. About 3/4ths of the way up he felt like he was dying of dehydration and decided that having some fluids in him was better than none and he could be cured of the poison back in the town, so Tim drank the wiper fluid. The fluids in him again had him feeling rejuvenated and he pushed to the top of the dune.\n\nWhen he reached the top his head was spinning from the wiper fluid but he had made it! He crested the peak and looked out into the falling sun expecting to see the village. Unfortunately all he saw around him was desert. Disheartened he looked to going back down the dune when he noticed something, a smallish wooden and straw structure half buried in the sand. He started crawling down the dune toward the structure, now fully feeling the effects of the poison. He crawled into an opening in the structure and by this time he was barely conscious. Inside the structure was a golden colored lever. This confused Tim, and when he stood up to try and push it, his head started spinning something bad and he collapsed into unconsciousness. \n\nTim woke up to light coming through the cracks in the building and felt rejuvenated. He felt healthy. \"How is this possible?\" Tim thought to himself, \"am I dead?\" Tim started to sit up, those questions floating through his head when all of a sudden he was face to face with a snake. And much to Tim's astonishment, the snake began to speak. \"Hello I am nate the snake\" The snake said. Tim was confused and scared but he worked up the nerve to sputter out a few \"whats\" and \"hows.\" The snake interrupted Tim's unintelligible babbling to say \"Travelers usually don't find this place, and the ones that do get 2 wishes. I saw that you were poisoned, dehydrated, and dying so I granted a wish on your behalf allowing you to survive and stay healthy without a need for food and water.\" This made about as much sense as any explanation that Tim thought of so he accepted it. The next question that came to Tim's mind concerned the lever. Nate the Snake began to explain: \n\"The lever is a doomsday lever, in fact, this area used to be what you know as the garden of eden. This lever was supposed to destroy the world and all its inhabitants if the animals became corrupt or evil, since then humanity has spread all across the planet and we can't have the world ending now can we?\" \n\nTim didn't quite buy it but the snake continued his story: \"I am descendant of a generation of serpents supposed to guard this lever and make sure no travelers, such as yourself, wander across this lever and push it killing everybody.\" \nBy this point Tim was so confident he was hallucinating that he just went along with it. The snake asked if Tim had any questions: \n\"Ya so do you know where the village is?\" Tim asked. Nate the Snake replied with a short \"no\" and continued to talk on about how Tim is the first person he'd seen in many many years, as it became more apparent that Tim didn't really care, Nate the Snake pointed out that Tim still had one wish. \"Oh right!\" Tim exclaimed and proceeded to ask Nate for an internal compass so that Tim would always know where he wanted to go. Suddenly, Tim knew the way to the village, it was about a days walk southeast of where the structure was. With that in mind, Tim thanked Nate and promised to visit again (still thinking he's hallucinating but at least he has a direction to go now) and he set out southeast to where he hoped the town was.\n\nTim stumbled into town later in the day convinced that he was just lucky and that the Nate the Snake encounter was a fever dream on account of the poison. He checked into a hospital and was given drugs to flush out the toxins but he was fine. He decided to cut his trip short on account of his odd adventure in the desert and he took a bus back to Cairo the next day then flew home. Tim continued his life where he left off, and he told all his friends about his ordeal in the desert, and he went on with his normal life for about 5 years.\n\nThen one day Tim was going to go out to eat with is friends and something occurred to him: he hadn't eaten or drank anything in over a week, he'd just been too busy and didn't think of it. This puzzled Tim as he racked his brain to figure out why then suddenly the whole Nate the Snake encounter came flooding back to him. If he didn't need to eat or drink, that means the whole encounter much had actually happened! Tim became terrified then excited as he considered the possibilities of it then he remembered the promise he made to Nate to come back and visit him. He hastily bought a ticket to Cairo for the weekend and took a couple days off work. The flight was uneventful and he ended up in Cairo where he took a bus to the small village.\n\nTim didn't have the money to rent a car this time but since he didn't need to eat or drink he figured  he could just walk to Nate's domain. With his internal map pointing the way, Tim set off into the desert to the Northwest and walked for the rest of the afternoon and well into the night. By the time the sun was rising behind him, Tim walked over the final dune and saw the small wood and grass structure that housed the lever. When Tim was approaching the structure, Nate the Snake slithered out in front of him. \"Tim!\" Nate the Snake exclaimed, \"I thought you'd forgot about me\" \nTim felt blood rushing into his cheeks as he felt ashamed about forgetting, \"Im sorry Nate, Ive just been so busy living my life and honestly, i chocked our whole meeting up to hallucinations due to the poison\"\n\"Thats understandable\" nate said \"Thank you for coming back though it really means a lot to me, anyway I have someone to introduce you to.\"\nAs if on cue, a smaller snake slithered out.\n\"Tim\" Nate continued, \"This is my son Joe\"\n\"Oh hi there\" Tim said\n\"Now tim,\" Nate said, \"I actually have a huge favor to ask you, my son, Joe, will take over my job when I die and be bound to guard the lever forever. I want you to take Joe with you and show him the world, I know this is a lot to ask but please, I want him to see the world before he's bound to the lever forever\"\n\nTim was hesitant but he figured that Nate had saved his life, so he owed him that favor. So after the meeting, Tim and Joe trekked back across the desert to the village and back to Cairo. Nate quit his job and they spent the remainder of his money traveling the world. Tim and Joe travelled Asia first, then the americas and finally they went to europe. It was around the 5th month of the traveling and Tim and Joe ended up in a bar in Norway. Over some beers they were discussing their plans next and Joe spoke up saying that they had been gone for a while and that it might be time to go back.  Tim agreed that it was time and they flew out to Cairo a few days later.\n\nThey landed in Cairo and took the bus to the village and started walking the day and a half journey to Nate and Joe's home. After about 6 hours of walking, Tim and Joe came across a car half buried in the sand. Tim brushed off the sand and unburied it from the sand before climbing inside. After checking out the car and briefly looking at the engine, Tim concluded that it was in working order. Tim and Joe searched a little bit for a person to whom the car belonged but found nobody around, so they hot-wired the car and started driving to shave off many hours from their journey. \n\nAfter a few hours of driving they were nearing the lever and started the last downhill section toward the lever. The car started picking up speed so Tim applied the break, and nothing happened. Tim started panicking and slamming the break but the car didn't slow down at all. \"Whats wrong?\" Joe asked with a tone of fear in his voice.\n\"The car's breaks or jammed it isn't working\"\nTim and Joe both pushed on the breaks as hard as they could but nothing happened. They turned off the engine in desperation but the car kept sliding toward the structure, suddenly, Nate came out of the structure to the left facing away from the car but he couldn't hear because the engine was off. There was a flat area behind the structure so Tim figured if he just turned right he could roll to a stop.\n\nTim turned the wheel right but the car didn't shift at all because the tires were stuck in a groove. Tim kept trying to turn it but nothing was happening, he briefly by accident shifted the wheel left and the car moved. The car was going quickly toward the lever building and they had to make a move. Tim kept yelling \"What do I do?\" to Joe, he could either hit the building or move left and hit Nate because the car wouldn’t go right. Joe was rather quiet and then he looked Tim with tears in his and rested his tail upon the wheel and started pushing it to the left. Tim looked confused and scared as joe maneuvered the car so that it would hit Nate. Tim looked at Joe and asked, \"Why?\" and Joe looked back, crying now, and said:\n\nBetter Nate than lever."

      "full_joke": "The Story of Mike Doe! Hey, my name’s Mike Doe, and this is my story. I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must’ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, “Hey Mike! You’ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!” I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother’s grandfather’s nephew’s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he’d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn’t always bad.\n\nGood old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don’t think he liked it much. He didn’t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn’t start running after five minutes. I’m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family’s latest adventures.\n\nThere was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. “You know Michael,” he started as I prepared my apology, “I really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don’t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.” I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.\n\nOur year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert’s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.\n\nWork was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn’t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.\n\nFrom the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.\n\nHowever, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance. Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy’s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, “Mikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don’t do anything stupid.”\n\nThe standoff lasted for hours. If it weren’t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn’t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy’s voice at one point yelling orders like, “Dimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.” None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, “Clear!” As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today’s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes. God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this? When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.\n\n“Mike! Thank God you’re still alive. I’m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.”\n\n“What? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?”\n\n“We found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn’t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.” He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.\n\nI frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. “Robert?” I choked the question out in disbelief. He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. “You mean to tell me that all of these guys… They’re all your family?”\n\nRobert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, “I told you we don’t forget Mike. All the Goodings come to Doe’s who wait. ”"

The man works late, and though he would've preferred to prepare some Thai food on this particular night, his job has rendered him far too exhausted to cook. Sadly, the company behind the fried chicken chain seems to target his particular demographic in their historical geographic locations, resulting in the perpetuation of a stereotype that under most circumstances the man wishes to avoid, primarily due to health reasons (though admittedly, in a small way, the meal does remind him of his distant Southern roots and did once act as a treat of sorts during the two years he spent in Japan). Tuning the radio to NPR, the man slowly peels some of the greasy excess skin of the hormone-infused poultry product and contemplates his life as a bachelor. Soon he resolves to find a suitable domestic partner, preferably one who doesn't work so late and is in possession of extra-normal sandwich making skills."

Acting carefully, Joseph removed the splinter with his knife. After successfully removing it, the elephant looked at him and stomped its foot several times. Joseph stayed still, with the fear of imminent death. After stomping its foot, the elephant trumpeted loudly and walked away. Joe never forgot that day.\n\nThirty years later, Joseph was with his family at the Tulsa Zoo when an elephant walked up to Joseph's side of the enclosure and stomped its foot several times. Remembering the incident from thirty years ago, Joseph couldn't help but wonder if this was the same elephant.\n\nMustering all the courage he had, Joseph climbed over the fence and into the enclosure. He walked up to the elephant and held its gaze for several minutes before the elephant trumpeted. The elephant then wrapped its trunk around Joseph, picked him up, and then slammed him against the fence, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same elephant."

      "full_joke": "[OC] An old blacksmith was working in his shop... when there was a terrible accident. The fire in his forge had gone out of control and set fire to the shop. The blacksmith nearly lost his life. He was bedridden for many months and relied on the help of his children and grandchildren to feed him, bathe him, and take care of all of his needs. Eventually he was able to get back on his feet, though his outlook on life had turned quite grim. He was now able to take care of himself, but he had lost much of his strength and dexterity from the injuries he sustained and he was unable to practice his trade. He fell into a deep depression and he spent most of his days sitting at home in front of the fireplace gazing into the flames, longing for the days when his strong hands could grasp a hammer and strike a hot piece of iron, slowly forging it into a beautiful piece of work. \n\nOne evening when the old man was sitting in front of the fire, he heard a knock at the door. It was his granddaughter, whom he hadn't seen in many months. She had overheard her father talking to her mother about how her grandfather was slowly slipping away into depression and hopelessness and she wanted to help. To the old man's surprise, she had brought him a puppy. \"I thought that since you're always here all by yourself that you might want someone you keep you company,\" the granddaughter said. The old man's eyes welled up with tears and the little puppy instantly jumped into his arms and began licking the tears from his face. The old man and his granddaughter spent the next several hours sitting on the floor of his house watching the puppy chase around a rubber ball, bouncing, jumping, panting, and licking. In that short time, the old man had made complete turnaround from being sad, lonely, and hopeless, to smiling from ear to ear, full of joy with his new-found companion. As the hours grew late and the puppy grew tired, the granddaughter said \"Well Opa, I'm glad you like your puppy, but it's late and I should be heading home. By the way, what are you going to call him?\" \"Life,\" said the old man, \"because he has given me a new meaning and joy to mine.\" The granddaughter kissed her grandfather on the cheek, wished him goodnight, and she left. \n  \nMany years passed and all the while, the old man and his little dog were inseparable. Everywhere the old man went, Life was always with him whether it was the post office, the grocery store, and even when the old man went to the barber shop, the little dog would sit patiently until the last hair on the old man’s head had been cut . The granddaughter would often come to visit to see how her grandfather and the dog were doing, and she was always glad to see that her grandfather was still happy. But at night, the old man would still sit in front of the fireplace with Life on his lap, gazing into the fireplace as flames cast dancing shadows across the room and he fell asleep to thoughts of his old smithing days. \n  \nOne morning as the old man was getting the morning newspaper from the front porch, Life sprinted past him through the front door because he had spotted a squirrel across the street. Before the little dog could catch up with his prey, a speeding car struck the poor animal. The car came to a screeching halt and the old man hobbled as quickly as his old legs could carry them to his precious companion who lay whimpering on the side of the road. The little dog was alive but badly injured. The man who was driving the car got out to apologize to the old man, but his regrets went unnoticed by the weeping old man who only wanted to tend to his injured dog. Life’s two hind legs appeared limp and broken and the dog panted and whimpered as the old man carried him back into the house. The old man knew that his dog’s injuries required medical attention but because he was out of work, he wasn’t able to afford a veterinarian. Determined, the old man did the only thing he knew how to do. He found some of his old blacksmithing tools and scrap metal from his garage and proceeded to start a fire in his fireplace. His hands lacked the strength and precision they once had but eventually, he was able to forge a crude set of brackets that would hold the dog’s legs in place as his injuries healed. The old man tended to dog’s every need until eventually, Life was able to stand up on his own and soon enough, the dog could walk, and after a few more weeks, he could even manage a awkward, limping run. Unfortunately, the old blacksmith’s craftsmanship was lacking due to his own previous injuries and the braces that he had forged would often break when the dog ran too quickly, so the old man found himself back at the fireplace with his tools forging replacement parts for his little dog’s leg braces. It was tiresome, difficult work with his old frail hands, but he was determined to give his dog the best life that he could, so he kept at it. \n  \nOne day, as the old man was forging a new set of parts for his dog’s leg braces, an ember jumped from the fireplace, catching the carpet on fire. The old man couldn’t get to the kitchen quickly enough to get a pail of water to put the fire out and tragically, the old blacksmith and his dog both perished as the house was engulfed in flames. \n  \nThe next day, the granddaughter and her father came to where the old blacksmith’s house once stood and they began to search through the ashes and rubble for anything they could salvage as a keepsake of their lost loved one. “You know,” said the girl to her father, “I’m really happy that grandpa’s last years were as joyful as they were. Even though he was really sad that he couldn’t make a living as a blacksmith anymore, he really did seem happy after I brought him that puppy.” “Yes dear,” said the father. The daughter continued, “But isn’t it sad how his house was burnt down when he was making one of those leg braces for his dog?” The father looked down and picked up a small piece of metal from the ashes and said “That’s one of Life’s little iron knees.”"

No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.\"\n\nWell, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.\n\nThe switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.\n\nThe executioner was speechless.\n\nThe man looked at the executioner and said \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.

The first day we had a great time going around las ramblas and going taking pictures at La Sagrada familia. That night we even attended a Barcelona game against Real Madrid. It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman. I said “I’m amazed that a hotel this small has a full time doctor as skilled as yourself!” She replied “no one expects the Spanish inn physician.”\n\ncredit to u/ClintonHarvey for the pun"

The three men, friendly rivals, decide among themselves that what this bear needs to be soothed is some religion, so they declare it a contest to see who can convert it. They draw straws, and the Catholic priest is the first to try.\n\nHe heads into the woods, and comes back three hours later with a few claw swipes across his face and hands, and tells the other two, \"I read from the Catechism, and the bear seemed to enjoy that, but when I sprinkled him with holy water, he tried to maul me, and I ran!\"\n\nThe Protestant minister is the second to go, and he's gone all evening, meeting his friends the next afternoon, with a bandage around his head and a broken leg. He says to them, \"I found the bear by the river, and I preached to him from God's holy word, and he was as gentle as a lamb, until I tried to baptize him in the river; he nearly bit my head off and I had to bolt for my life!\"\n\nLastly went the Jewish Rabbi, off into the woods. His friends hear nothing from him for two days, until they receive the word that he's in hospital. They rush over to find him in the ICU, a cast covering most of his body, and vicious wounds all over the rest of him. They frantically ask him what happened, and between laboured breaths through the ventilator, he mutters, \"You know, thinking about it, I probably shouldn't've opened with the circumcision.."

She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.\n \nThe president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.\n \nThe president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'\n \nThe elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'\n \nThe president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.         \nThe woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'\n \n'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'\n \n'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.\n \nThat night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.\n \nThe next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square.\n \nThe president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.\n \nThe president was happy to oblige.\n \nThe elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked   the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'\n \nThe elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland.'"

      "full_joke": "How do you catch a polar bear? First, one must determine a reasonable location in which to expect polar bears to be lurking.  They are generally found in Arctic regions.  Second, you'll need to distribute a number of well-camouflaged bear traps, such as the one [pictured here](http://chanteepps.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bear-trap.jpg) in areas that one might expect polar bears to be searching for food.  Since they are carnivores, one can expect them [primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear#Hunting_and_diet).  This will pose a challenge to some, but it can be done.  \n\nThe next crucial step is to monitor the traps from a safe distance, as these bears can be quite dangerous.  Additionally, should you luck out and snare one, caution should be taken not to allow enough time to pass that the bear either starves or gnaws its leg off in order to escape.  It would be prudent to shoot the animal with a tranquilizer potent enough to render it safely unconscious without risking a fatal overdose.  \n\nIt is crucial to keep in mind that the polar bear is an apex predator, meaning they have no natural prey and they play a role in keeping their own prey in check from a population standpoint; any drastic shift in the predator/prey dynamic can have unintended consequences upon the environment and negative effects on other species, as well as the indigenous peoples who hunt them.  \n\nFinally, it should be noted that polar bears are considered a threatened species under the [Endangered Species Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act) and, as such, you may be breaking the law by attempting to trap or kill such an animal.  Violations of this law could result in steep penalties for the person in question, and trapping of polar bears should therefore be avoided entirely, for legal reasons if not ethical ones."

It's going to be **very very** long. Just did a word count online: 2800 words. You've been warned.\n\nThere once was a bright kingdom, with a great King, it a very large castle. He had a beautiful daughter, who all of the Knights wished to marry. When she came of age, many Knights asked for her hand. The King, being a great King, allowed her to choose her own suitor. But one by one, all of the knights were turned down.\n\nOne day a young, young squire ran to the castle. He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.\n\n\"Halt, who goes there?\" asked the guards in unison.\n\n\"It is I, the King's squire, here to deliver unto him an important message,\" said the squire.\n\n\"And what is the message?\" one asked.\n\n\"The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage!\" exclaimed the squire.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" both guards gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed.\n\nSo the guards let him pass. The drawbridge was lowered, and the squire ran to the throne room. The drawbridge clacked shut behind him. At the door he was stopped by the Herald.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" asked the Herald.\n\n\"It is I,\" said the squire, \"the King's squire. I have for him a message.\"\n\n\"And it is?\" asked the Herald.\n\n\"\"The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!\" exclaimed the squire.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the herald gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed.\n\nSo the Herald opened the door and blared his trumpet.\n\n\"Announcing the King's squire, travelling to give the King an important message!\"\n\nThe squire scurried into the room and kneeled before the great King.\n\n\"Speak!\" bellowed the King.\n\n\"It is I, your squire, my Lord. I am here to deliver unto you an important message,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Get on with it already,\" said the King.\n\n\"My liege. The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!\" exclaimed the squire.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the King gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed.\n\nJust then there was a ruckus at the drawbridge. Faintly, the king could hear the guardsmen shouting something.\n\nDistantly, the sound of the drawbridge lowering cut through the air. \n\nThrough the door the King heard the Herald.\n\n\"Halt! What business have you with the King?\"\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, and I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage.\"\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" gasped the Herald.\n\n\"Yes, the Black Black Knight,\" he said, \"Now get out of my way before I kill you.\"\n\nThe door was kicked open and a seven-foot tall man clad in armour blacker than the moonless night sky strode before the great King. He didn't bother kneeling.\n\n\"Insolence!\" cried the King, \"What business have you here?\"\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, and I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage.\"\n\n\"No, not the Black Black Knight,\" gasped the King.\n\n\"Yes, the Black Black Knight,\" he said, \"now let me see your daughter before I kill you.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said the great King. \"She is at the top of the longest staircase in the tallest tower, guarded by a magical portrait.\"\n\nSo the Black Black Knight headed for the tower. He climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed. And then he climbed some more. Finally, after a day's march, he came to a magical, moving portrait. \n\n\"State your business with the Princess,\" said the portrait.\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the portrait gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed. \"Now move before I kill you.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said the portrait, and swung aside revealing a doorway.\n\nAs he stepped through, the Princess, shocked, screeched and backed against the wall.\n\n\"Who are you, and how did you get in here?!\" she cried.\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to ask for the your hand in marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed. \"Now, give me an answer.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Princess, obviously distraught. \"I've never met you nor do I know if the tales about you are true. I believe a husband should be strong, and brave and able to protect me from anything. And I need proof. Go to the Red Mountain of the South, defeat the ruby red dragon and bring me back a ruby red dragon scale.\"\n\n\"Fine, I shall fetch you your trinket. And then you will give me an answer,\" said the Black Black Knight.\n\nSo the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the base of the Red Mountain of the South.\n\nHe looked around for days, then weeks, until he finally found a hidden cave entrance. He went inside and noticed it was incredibly hot. Gouts of flame shot from the ground, and from fissures in the walls.\n\n\"Sssssstop,\" said a booming, serpentine voice, \"who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?\"\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the ruby red dragon, and bring a ruby red scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the dragon gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed. \"Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.\"\n\nThere was a terrifying battle. It lasted for a whole day. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the ruby red dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's neck. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom, riding for days and days and days without rest.\n\nHe was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.\n\n\"Halt, who goes there?\" asked the guards in unison.\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight here to deliver the Princess her trinket,\" said the Black Black Knight.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" both guards gasped.\n\n\"Yes!

It couldn't have been too hard. I don't know if I can trust you to protect me. Go, ride to the Blue Cave of the North, do battle with the sapphire blue dragon, and bring me a sapphire blue scale. Only then will I know you're worthy.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said the Black Black Knight, \"and then you will give me an answer.\"\n\nSo the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the mouth of the Blue Cave of the North.\n\nHe looked around for days, then weeks, until he finally found a hidden cave entrance. He went inside and noticed that the walls and floor were all very icy and slippery. His armour was forming frost just by being there. \n\n\"Sssssstop,\" said a booming, serpentine voice, \"who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?\"\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the sapphire blue dragon, and bring a sapphire blue scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the dragon gasped.\n\n\"Yes!

The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed. \"Now move before I kill you.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said the portrait, and swung aside revealing a doorway.\n\nHe stepped inside and the Princess turned to see him.\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have ridden to the Blue Cave of the South, defeated the sapphire blue dragon, and I am here to deliver its sapphire blue scale, that I may earn your hand in marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"So you fought it and killed it in fair battle, did you?\" she asked.\n\n\"I did,\" said the Black Black Knight.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Princess. \"It's impressive, but I thought the scale would be bigger. It couldn't have been too hard. I don't know if I can trust you to protect me. Go, ride to the Emerald Forest of the East, do battle with the emerald green dragon, and bring me a emerald green scale. Only then will I know you're worthy.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said the Black Black Knight, \"and then you will give me an answer.\"\n\nSo the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the edge of the Emerald Forest of the East.\n\nHe looked around for days, then weeks, until he found a barely used path that wound through the forest for a very long time. He looked around and noticed everything was dense and overgrown. \n\n\"Sssssstop,\" said a booming, serpentine voice, \"who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?\"\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the emerald green dragon, and bring a emerald green scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the dragon gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed. \"Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.\"\n\nThere was a terrifying battle. It lasted for three whole days. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the emerald green dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's chest. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom, riding for days and days and days without rest.\n\nHe was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.\n\n\"Halt, who goes there?\" asked the guards in unison.\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight here to deliver the Princess her trinket,\" said the Black Black Knight.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" both guards gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed. \"Now move before I kill you.\n\nSo the guards let him pass. The drawbridge was lowered, and the Black Black Knight walked to the throne room. The drawbridge clacked shut behind him. At the door he was stopped by the Herald.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" asked the Herald.\n\n\"It is I,\" said the Knight, \"the Black Black Knight. I have the princess' trinket.\"\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the herald gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" he confirmed. \"Now move before I kill you.\"\n\nSo the Herald opened the door and blared his trumpet.\n\n\"Announcing the Black Black Knight, he who rode to the Emerald Forest of the East and defeated the emerald green dragon has come bearing its scale for the Princess!\"\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the King gasped.\n\n\"Yes! The Black Black Knight!\" the Knight confirmed. \"Now let me see the Princess before I kill you.\"\n\nSo the Black Black Knight headed for the tower. He climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed. And then he climbed some more. Finally, after a day's march, he came to a magical, moving portrait. \n\n\"State your business with the Princess,\" said the portrait.\n\n\"It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have ridden to the Emerald Forest of the East, defeated the emerald green dragon, and I am here to deliver its emerald green scale, that I may earn the Princess' hand in marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Not the Black Black Knight!\" the portrait gasped.\n\n\"Yes!

I've conquered the ruby red dragon of the Red Mountain of the South, the sapphire blue dragon of the Blue Cave of the North, and the emerald green dragon of the Emerald Forest of the East. I have brought you scales from each of the slain beasts. Will you marry me now?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Princess. \"I think I'd rather not."

The admiral blurted out that they were both full of shit and that everyone in the country knew that the U.S. sailors were the bravest of our fighting men.\n\nThe three bickered back and forth for some time and finally agreed that they should put their men to the test, which they would personally monitor.\n\nFirst they went to the airbase where they boarded a bomber that was scheduled to make some practice bombing runs. They were about to come over the target when the Air Force general walked up to one of the crew and said: \"airman, I want you to ride that bomb down right to the dead center of that target.\" Without hesitation, the airman saluted the general, climbed aboard the bomb, released the holding mechanism and rode the bomb right to the dead center of the target and was blown all to hell. The Air Force general looked at his friends and said: \"that's bravery.\"\n\nTheir next stop was the Army camp where they were holding maneuvers to practice heavy armor tactics. The Army general walks up to one of his men and said, while pointing to a tank speeding toward them, \"Private stop that tank.\" The Soldier ran toward the tank waving his arms and yelling \"STOP, STOP\" and was flattened flatter than a pancake. The Army man looked at his friends and said: \"that's bravery\".\n\nThe three adjourned for a quick drink and proceeded to the Admiral's flagship and went all the way up to the Admiral's bridge. When they had arrived on the bridge the three looked up and saw a man painting the mast way above them. \n\nThe Admiral yelled out: \"Hey, you there aloft.\" The seaman painting the mast looked down, saluted and replied: \"Yes sir\".

Once he gets there he pulls himself up on the frame pops the door open and takes a deep breath of the cool night air. \nHe instantly feels better and decides he can walk now. Once again he takes one step and falls flat on his face.\n\n\"Shoot, I must be worse than I thought!\"\nHe looks down the road at his home, and realizes that if he could Army crawl to door of the bar, he could do the same to his front door. So he painstakingly begins crawling to his home.\n\nAbout 20 minutes of painstakingly inching himself home he finally makes it. Covered in sweat he decides to try walking again. \"I must have burnt off some of the alcohol by now, this should be easy.\" He pulls himself up the frame of his front door, opens it up and takes a step inside. Once again, his face finds the floor immediately.\n\n\"Screw this! I just need to sleep this off.\" Being defeated he crawls upstairs, pulls himself into bed and drifts into a deep sleep.\n\nThe next morning He wakes up to a huge platter of food in front of him with his wife smiling over it. \"Wow Honey! This is great! All my favorites, eggs, bacon, sausage, and coffee! Why did you do this?\"\nHis wife lovingly responds \"Well I figured you would have a rough hangover and would need a pick me up.\"\nThe husband, confused by this asked \"I'm glad you are not mad that I was out so late, but how did you know I was going to be so hungover and would have a rough morning?\"\n\n\"Well, the bartender called, you left your wheelchair at the bar last night."

As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.\n\nAfter a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, \"I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.\"\n\nThe distressed woman wailed, \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,\" replied the vet..\n\n\"How can you be so sure?\" she protested. \"I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.\"\n\nThe vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.\n\nThe vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.\n\nThe vet looked at the woman and said, \"I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.\"\n\nThe vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..\n\nThe duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. \"$150!\" she cried, \"$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!\"\n\nThe vet shrugged, \"I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150."

He proposes to her and she says yes. Then they both fall asleep in the field and he has a dream that a tractor was coming to run over him. He wakes and there is a tractor coming towards him! He quickly rolls away but his fiancée gets run over and killed.\n\nHe is obviously devastated and swears never to even look at a tractor ever again. So he tears down all his posters and spends all his time in his room, alone and depressed for a few weeks until his mother, again intervenes and gets him to go to the local pub again.\n\nWhen he arrives, the pub is on fire! He rushes in and takes a deep breath, sucking in all the fire and smoke.\n\nThe firemen immediately ask him how he did it. \n\n\"I'm an ex-tractor fan."

Otherwise I wouldn't be a professor, would I?\"   \n\nStudent: \"OK. So I'd like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can't give me the correct answer, however, you'll have to give me an \"A\".   \n\nProfessor: \"Hmmmm, alright. So what's the question?\"   \n\nStudent: \"What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? \"   \n\nThe professor wracks his famous brain, but just can't crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student's failing mark into an \"A\" as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased.   \n\nThe professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer: \"What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? \" \nTo the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands.   \n\n\"All right\" says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer \n  \n\"It's quite easy, sir\" says the student \"You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal. And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an \"A\", which is neither legal, nor logical."

So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.\n\nSo they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn't do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.\n\nWhen the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed. However, the moment they are disconnected, there's a massive electricity failure throughout the entire complex, leading to all the prisoners escaping due to lack of electric security systems.\n\nOf course, the managers are outraged, and start shouting at the technician: \"What the hell did you do? I told you to remove those damn drying boxes, not let all the inmates escape!\"\n\nThe technician says, calmly, \"I thought you knew what would happen if those drying machines were removed...\"\n\nThis does nothing to assuage the managers' anger, and they keep demanding an explanation as to why they should have know that there would be a power cut. After several minutes of argument, they finally get one.\n\n\"Don't you remember?\", says the technician. \"The mighty con drier is the powerhouse of the cell..."

She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'\nThe woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.\nShe says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'\nTo her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'\n'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.\n'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'\n'So I just switched the heads.'"

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.\nWhen the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, \"All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.\"\n\nBut the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.\n\nSoon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company's secret files.\n\nFrom the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.\n\nWithout even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other fire\nfighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.\n\nWithin a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.\n\nThe local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"\n\n\"Vell,\" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!"

In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University.\n\nOn a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same fucking elephant."

The chickens, being chickens, just walked about seemingly at random, and as the coop was presumed to be locked, the main gate was left open so the farmer could easily walk about. One of the chickens was following a trail of corn that came from a leak in one of the sacks the farmer was carrying, and so happened to leave the barnyard, and followed the farmer's tracks across the street. It wasn't long before the chicken caught up to the farmer, who quickly went to rectify his mistake, so no more of his livestock would escape or get injured by wildlife or farming equipment."

As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro for short).\n\nIn the first year, \"s\" will be used instead of the soft \"c.\" Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve this news with joy. Also, the hard \"c\" will be replased with \"k\". Not only will this klear up konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter.\n\nThere will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome \"ph\" will be replased by \"f\". This will make words like fotograf\" 20 persent shorter.\n\nIn the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of silent \"e\"s in the languag is disgrasful, and they would go.\n\nBy the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing \"th\" by \"z\" and \"w\" by \" v\".\n\nDuring ze fifz year, ze unesesary \"o\" kan be dropd from vords kontaining \"ou\", and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.\n\nAfter zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl.

The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbor.

I managed to pull myself together and go downstairs for breakfast, hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, \"Happy Birthday!\", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone \"Happy Birthday.\" I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember. \n\nMy kids came trampling down the stairs to breakfast, ate their breakfast, and didn't say a word to me. So when I made it out of the house and started for work, I felt pretty dumpy and despondent. \n\nAs I walked into my office, my secretary Joanne said, \"Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!\" It felt a bit better knowing that at least someone remembered. I worked in a zombie like fashion until about one o'clock, when Joanne knocked on my door and said, \"You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your Birthday, why don't we go out for lunch, just you and me.\" I said, \"Thanks, Joanne, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go!\" \n\nWe went to lunch but not where we'd normally go. Instead she took me to a quiet bistro with a private table. We had a couple of mixed drinks and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Joanne said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't have to go right back to the office, do we?\" I replied with \"I suppose not. What do you have in mind?\" She said, \"Let's go to my apartment, it's just around the corner.\" \n\nAfter arriving at her apartment, Joanne turned to me and said, \"Boss if you don't mind, I'm goinna to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.\" \"Ok.\" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... \n\nFollowed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends, and co-workers, all singing \"Happy Birthday\". \n\nAnd I just sat there... \n\nOn the couch... \n\nIn my birthday suit."

A young family moved into a house, next to a vacant lot. \n\nOne day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.\n\nThe young family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.\n\nEventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough,” more or less, adopted her as a project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.\n\nAt the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars. The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.\n\nWhen the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.\n\nThe little girl proudly replied,  “I worked last week with a real work crew building the new house next door to us.”\n\n“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week too?”\n\nThe little girl replied, “I will if those assholes at Home Depot ever deliver the f**king sheet rock…”"

After getting  engaged to the love of his life, he decides to find one. After some searching, he finds one for only $500. Immediately, he calls the owner and sets up a time to come look at the bike. \n\nUpon arrival, Greg meets this old man and asks him about the bike. The old man just smiles as he opens the garage and reveals the Harley in perfect showroom condition. Astonished, Greg asks the man how he kept the bike looking so new. With a chuckle, the old man says, \"it's an old family secret. Every time it's going to rain, I coat every inch of the bike in Vasoline. The water runs right off and keeps the bike looking new.\" Greg gives the man the money and loads the bike up. \n\nAfter getting it home, he starts the bike up and takes off to pick up his fiancée to have dinner with her parents, stopping to get some Vasoline for the bike. \n\nWhen they arrive, she stops him at the doorstep and says, \"there's something you need to know about my family. Nobody talks during dinner. Whoever speaks first has to wash all the dishes.\" Greg nods and they go inside. \n\nHe's met with an entryway that has a tiny path leading inside.  On either side of the path are dishes stacked floor to ceiling. As he walks further into the house he sees the living room filled with dishes, floor to ceiling, except for a tiny path to the couch and between the couch and TV. The stairs, the halfway, the rooms, all riddled with dishes floor to ceiling. \n\nWhen dinner starts, everyone sits down and starts eating, and sure enough, nobody says a word. \n\nAbout five minutes in, Greg thinks, *I can have fun with this* and reaches over and grabs his fiancée's titty. \n\nThe father glares at him, the mother acts like she didn't see anything, but sure enough, nobody says a word. \n\nDelighted by this reaction, Greg grabs his fiancée, throws her on the table, rips off her pants and begins fucking her right in the table. \n\nThe father is fuming, the mother gasps loudly, but... nobody says a word. \n\nGreg sits back down and begins to eat again. After several more minutes, he decides to go even further and reaches over and grabs the mother's titty, throws her on the table, and behind fucking her. \n\nThe father clenched his fists, turns multiple shades of red, veins pop out of his forehead. The anger can be felt for miles. \n\nBut, nobody says a word.\n\nExhausted, Greg begins to eat again, but suddenly hears a loud clap of thunder in the distance. As the old man's words echo in his head, he stands up and pulls out his jar of Vasoline. \n\nSuddenly, the father slams his hands on the table and shouts, \"Alright, enough! I'll do the goddamned dishes! "

      "full_joke": "Pink Bicycle (warning: wall of text anti-joke) For his sixth birthday a father gave his son a pink bicycle. The son was confused and asked his father why it was pink. The father just looked at the son and said \"I'll tell you when you're older\". The kid asked again, as kids are wont to do \"I'm older now, can you tell me?\" The reply was as expected \"No son, I mean really older, now go ride your bike.\" So the son did go ride the bike anyway, even though it was pink and he got a bit of flak from his friends for it. After a few days he hid the bike in the back of the garage, told his dad it had been stolen by a bully and promptly forgot about it. Until his next birthday. This time he got a video game from his father and all was alright, but it brought up the question again. \"Dad? Why did you get me a pink bicycle last year for my birthday?\" The dad got a little upset and spewed the same old line \"I'll tell you when you're older.\" This same scene played out on the eighth birthday as it brought back the memory of the pink bicycle. And again on the ninth and so on until the son moved out for college and he rarely returned for his birthdays. Occasionally he'd remember the pink bicycle and be reminiscent and still often confused as to why his father gave him a pink bicycle, but never quite found the time to call him up and ask something that was now so trivial. Years pass, the son grows up and has a wonderful life and as time often does it wears on the years of age and the father gets old and ill, on his deathbed. The son is having to prepare his old childhood home for the father's eventual passing, so is having a garage sale. He comes across the pink bike in the back of the garage. Laughing to himself, he decides not to sell it, but it does bring back the old question, so later that day while visiting his father in the hospital he asks. \"Father, it's been forty years. I'm sufficiently old enough now. Will you finally tell me the question that's plagued me my entire life? Why, on my sixth birthday, did you get me a pink bicycle?\" The father, laughing a bit, simply nods and smiles with joy at his son. He agrees, it's finally time to explain. \"Son. You know I love you very much. You know I'm quite proud of you and all you've done with your life. I told you when you were six that I'd tell you when you're older.\" he wheezes with his bad lung, the pause causes some anxiety with the son giving just the proper dramatic effect. \"The reason son,\" he coughs, \"the reason I got you a pink bicycle when you were six--\" The father coughs again. Pausing to catch his breath, but he can't catch it. He stops breathing and the doctors and nurses all rush in to try to save him. It is to no avail and the father dies there in the hospital. The son makes the final arrangements, goes back home to stare at the pink bicycle he'd rescued from the back of his father's old garage. He never found out why his father had given it to him.\n\nEDIT: You were warned!"

He is an extensively educated and experienced professional, and I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way.\" So they did.\nHowever, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition.\n\nFurious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to execute the weatherman at once! He summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster.\n\nThe farmer said, \"Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting.

The nanny, we'll consider her the working class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.\" The little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, \"Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.\" The father says, \"Good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.\" The little boy replies, \"Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit."

After a few bites, and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, “These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday!”\n\nThe waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, “Si, senor.

She wants a nice, even tan and since her yard has a high fence around it so she decides to strip naked. \n\nWith the warm sun on her skin and all the sounds of a hot summers day she starts drifting into sleep.\n\nSuddenly she comes fully awake to the sensation of something crawling up her inner thigh! Still groggy she tries to determine what it is, and to her horror she sees the end of a bee disappear into her vagina!\n\nHalf panicking she throws on some clothes and heads for her doctor. When the doctor enters the examination room, she explains her predicament and her worry. \n\n\"And you're sure the bee is still inside you?\"\n\n\"Of course I am! What am I supposed to do about it?!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, just call your husband and have him meet you at home. Take some honey and cover the tip of his penis with it and let him enter you slowly. When he feels the bee eating the honey, just have him exit you real slow and pull the bee with him!\"\n\nAmazingly this plan calmed the woman some, but it had a huge flaw:\n\n\"I'm not married, and I have no boyfriend!\"\n\n\"Don't you have any close friends you could ask to help you?\"\n\n\"I don't have time for that, can't you do it? It's your plan and everything!\"\n\n\"Hmm, well I guess the situation is quite time dependent. Lay here on the bed and uncover yourself while I get some honey.\"\n\nAs the woman got situated the doctor got a bottle of honey from the lunch room. When he returned he took out his penis and covered the tip. Slowly he entered the woman until he was almost completely inside her.\n\n\"There he is! He just started eating the honey.\"\n\n\"Great! Does he stick to you when you pull out?\"\n\n\"No, he keeps dropping off!\"\n\nSo, the doctor goes slowly forward and backward and forward and backward trying to pull out the bee, he's getting more and more frustrated since the bee seems to go nowhere. Suddenly he increases his speed to a fast pace.\n\n\"What are you doing?! He'll never stick when you're going this fast!\"\n\n\"I changed my mind, I'll shoot that son of a bitch!"

My dad passed away last year and my mom doesn't spend much time with me as she's usually very tired after drinking wine. I know that you brought all those rich kids from school plenty of fancy toys last year, but I don't care for these. However, I wish you could bring me a hat, a scarf and a pair of gloves, so I could go out and play with my friends in the snow. That would be the most beautiful day of my life. With love, Johnny\".\nA post office employee intercepts the letter, reads if, and is moved by the little kid's story. She decides to go around the office and collect some money to buy little Johnny the gift he's been dreaming of.\nAfter chasing everyone in the office, she manages to gather $13... $14... $15. After work, she goes to a little shop nearby to buy the hat, scarf and gloves. Unfortunately, she only has enough money for a hat and a scarf. Oh well, that should do just fine. She wraps the gift, attaches a letter with it \"Dear Johnny, here is the gift you've asked me for. Enjoy the company of your friends on this very special day. Your friend, Santa\", and sends it to the kid. She feels great - a little kid's dream has been achieved thanks to her and her colleagues from the post office.\nOne week later, she intercepts another letter from the kid addressed to Santa, and is excited to read about the kid's wonderful Christmas Day: \"Dear Santa. I received your gift, thank you very much. Unfortunately, I couldn't go out and play with my friends and had to stay home with my mom (she gets pretty mean after two bottles of wine), because there were only a hat and a scarf in the box (no gloves), and my mom wouldn't let me go out without a pair of gloves. It's probably those fuckers from the post office who stole the gloves. Love, Johnny"

He is met with a subtle frown from the three clergymen, because this is not new to them. The men suffer from having to be met with this utterly outworn cliché whenever wanting to relax from their stressful professions. Outside their respective temples, they prefer not to emphasise their daytime spiritual services, and will not be subject to such ridicule. Rather, they view themselves as three friends, companions if you will, and they all silently acknowledge the beauty that is acceptance of each other despite considerable differences in religious practise.\n\nSlightly offended, they once again find themselves outside the bar, contemplating alternate ways to spend what remains of their evening."

She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.\n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\"\n\n\"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\"\n\nIn a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.\n\nAs he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost."

A couple of years ago I was about to propose to my girlfriend when all of a sudden my friend Joseph came barging through the door, tripping directly upon my glass coffee table, broken glass all over his face. This completely ruined the mood. Now I haven't known Joe for very long at this point, hell I didn't even know where he was from, but this put my romantic plans on hold while we helped him through his injuries.\n\nJoseph had got glass in his left eye, rendering the eye completely useless. He had to walk around for months with one of those cotton patches on while it healed. Then out of nowhere this bastard just disappeared... With my girlfriend!\n\nApparently through his struggling time after the injuries, they had became very close, they left me behind without as much as even a single note. I tried tracking them down through out the years but I've had no such luck.\n\nIn conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?"

He didn't have to say anything, as he pulled the tomahawk out of the cowboy's body and lifted it up into the air, to show his fellow warriors that they still had strength; that this land was still theirs and no man, even those armed with guns or cannons could take it from them. There, among the vicious sight of the countless settler wagons burning in the dusty plains, they stood, eerily proud of their folly. They knew the shame that such an unprovoked attack would bring from their tribal elders. Even still, they did not care- victory was upon them. As a gesture of courage, or maybe it was insanity, the Indian licked the blood from the axe and screamed in joy, not knowing of the coming onslaught that was being planned by the revenge-hardened brother of his victim; a Ranger who watched from just over the ridge."

All of a sudden, the scrub clears up ahead and he's confronted by the strangest thing he has ever seen - off to the left is a big, blue house. \n\nThe blue house is surrounded by blue trees, blue grass and has a blue fence. Overawed by the sight of all this blue, and questioning his own sanity, the man failed to notice the bend coming up and crashed off the road, into a ditch. \n\nSeeing as apart from this house, he's in the middle of nowhere with no mobile reception, he figures he has no other choice but to go up to this creepy blue house. He walks through the blue gate, up the blue driveway and knocks on the blue door. \n\nAn elderly lady, wearing a blue dress, blue slippers and blue earrings opens the door, \"Hello..\" she said.\n\n\"Hi madam, I've just crashed my car across the road, and I wondered if I could come in and call the towing company. I really hope you don't mind.\" \n\n\"Oh, of course\" she replied, \"the phone's this way.\"\n\nThe man walked through the blue door, into the blue kitchen - noting the blue tiled floor, blue fridge and blue cupboards, and picks up the blue phone. Not wanting to offend the kind lady, he does not question the obsession with blue. While on the phone to the towing company, he discovers that a tow truck cannot be sent until the following morning. He relays this news to the lady, and she offers him a room to stay in overnight.\n\nThe man walked up the blue stairs, through another blue door into the spare bedroom. He lies down on the blue bed, under the blue bedspread, and drifts off to sleep looking at the blue ceiling.\n\nA few minutes later, another man is driving along the same country road. He too, is overawed by the blue estate confronting him, and, despite noticing the turn, cannot control his car and careers off into the same ditch. He walks up to the blue house, speaks to the lady dressed in blue and calls the same towing company with the same blue phone. He is given the same news as the previous man, and is offered a room by the old lady.\n\nHe walks into his blue bedroom, walking across the blue carpet, tossing his keys on the blue side table and drifting off to sleep in his blue bed.\n\nMeanwhile, a third gentlemen is driving down the road, and, noting the two cars in a ditch, drives far more carefully. However, he is incredibly fatigued and has a microsleep at the wheel, causing his car to run off the road into a tree, and down an embankment. He is fine, as is the car, however he will require the services of the tow truck too. He walks back up, and notices the big blue house. After deep consideration to ascertain whether he had suffered a mild brain injury or not (despite the low speed and glancing impact of the crash), he decides approaching the blue gate, to walk up to the blue door is the best option.\n\nHe uses the blue knocker, and the kindly old lady, still dressed in her blue outfit, opens the door. \n\n\"Can I guess\" she begins \"you've crashed your car and need to call the repairman?\"\n\nThe man says yes, and goes inside, along the blue hallway, into the blue kitchen with a blue phone, blue MixMaster and blue microwave oven. \n\n\"He won't be here until morning, the other two gentlemen have already called. I know how it sounds though, an old lady in the middle of nowhere offering you a place to stay overnight - call the company, their frustration doesn't outweigh your peace of mind.\"\n\nHe calls the towing company, and they confirm the veracity of the lady's comments. He walks up the blue stairs, having already consumed a glass of water from a blue glass, and enters the third blue spare room.

One by one he asks them each how they perished.\n\nThe first man: I live on the 6th floor of an apartment building in Manhattan, and for some months now I've been suspecting that my wife has been cheating on me.  I came home from work early today and find her in bed, fully naked and somewhat sweaty.  She insists she was just tired and hot, but I know the truth so I search the apartment.  I search and search, and I just can't find the guy who's been plowing her.  I give up and go out on my balcony for some air and to clear my head, and there the son of a bitch is, hanging from the bottom railing!  I was so angry I just started punching and kicking him, but he had some death grip or something; he just wouldn't let go.  I take off my shoe and I start beating his hands with it, and he eventually drops.  In my rage at my wife and at the horrible mess that is my life, I grabbed my refrigerator and hurled it over the balcony as well.  I then had a heart attack and died from the over exertion.\n\nSaint Peter nods that this is indeed a horrible death, so the man is allowed to enter Heaven.\n\nThe second man:  I live on the 7th floor of an apartment building in Manhattan, and I was out on my balcony for some air and enjoying the view as I always do after work, but when I leaned against my railing it came loose and I fell.  I was able to grab on to the bottom railing of the balcony below mine, where I clung for dear life praying someone would come rescue me.  Eventually someone came, but to my dismay he started punching and kicking me.  I held on for as long as I could, but when he took off his shoe and started hitting my fingers I eventually fell.  Somehow I managed to land in some bushes and I was just stunned.  I started to get up but then a refrigerator fell on me and squashed me.\n\nSaint Peter again agrees that this is horrible, so the man is allowed entry.\n\nThe third man:  Okay so picture this right?

I'd like you to give up all sexual contact with each other for the entire 40 days of Lent.\"\n\nThe husband swallows hard. The wife audibly gasps. But they look at each other, and then to the pastor. The husband says, \"Okay. We'll give it a shot.\"\n\nA week into Lent, they show up at the pastor's office looking a bit shamefaced. The pastor welcomes them in, and they can't seem to make eye contact. He knows it's gone wrong and he folds his hands, leans forward and says, \"Tell me what happened.\"\n\nThe young husband blurted out, \"We tried! We really tried. But the second day of Lent was our anniversary. We went out to dinner, had a bottle of wine, and when we got home, things just started to go, you know. Down a certain path.\" The wife said, \"But nothing happened — we danced and kissed briefly and then I made him sleep on the couch.\"\n\n\"The next night,\" the husband explained, \"We talked about it, and both felt pretty guilty. But as the evening wore on, I could tell that both of us were really wanting that physical intimacy. So I actually went to a friend's house and slept at his place.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said the pastor.\n\nThe husband said, \"And then yesterday evening, she was reaching up to grab a can of peas from the top shelf and, well, she just looked so beautiful — I mean, that's good, right? She's my wife! I'm supposed to find her arousing. She looked so good, I grabbed her, we kissed, and then we ripped off all of our clothes and had wild, passionate, loud, messy sex right there on the floor.\"\n\nThe pastor stood up, shook his head in disgust and said with considerable exasperation as he motioned toward the door, \"I'm sorry. But you are no longer welcome here at this church.\"\n\nThey got up to leave and the wife said, \"That's okay. We're not welcome at Kroger anymore either."

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’\n\nSo she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.\n\n‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.\n\nWell, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.\n\n‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.\n\nShe looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.\n\nI said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.\n\nShe fainted.”"

Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. \"I'm lost,\" said the man. \"Can you put me up for the night?\" \"Certainly,\" the Chinese man said, \"but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\" \"OK,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\" \"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost"

A few weeks go by without  any bites, but one day a man comes in.  The man had a hunched back and no arms, so the bishop was leary of his ability to perform the job, but the Lord teaches love and acceptance of all.  He says to the man, \"if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours.\"  \n\nElated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church's bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.\n\nWeeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, \"does anyone know this man?\"  Another replies...\n\n\"No, but his face sure rings a bell!\"\n\nWith a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.\n\nTo ensure the new ringer's safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, \"does anyone know this man?\"  And a voice replies...\n\n\"No, but he sure is a dead ringer for his brother!"

Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.\nWell, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.\n\n‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.\nShe looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.\n\nI said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.\n\nShe fainted."

Upon entering, they realized that it was inhabited by cannibals, and tried to leave but were captured. They were brought before the cannibal king, and the king stated that they would survive and be able to leave if they could pass a test. The first part of the test was to go into the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.\n\nThe first man returned to the camp and said to the king, \"I brought ten apples.\" The king then told him the second part of the test, which was to shove the fruit up his ass, and if he made any expression, either verbal or physical, he would be eaten. The man tried, but winced before he could get one apple in, so he was killed.\n\nThe second man arrived back at the campsite and showed the king ten blueberries. \"What do you want me to do next?\" he asked. The king replied by telling him that he had to shove the berries inside him, and if he made any expression, he would be eaten. \"This'll be easy, they're just small berries, they can fit.\" The man fit eight berries into his ass when he burst out laughing. Because he broke the rules of the king's test, he was eaten as well.\n\nThe first man and the second man met in heaven, and started talking about the king's test. The first one asked, \"Why did you laugh? You almost made it; you could've been able to leave.\" The man replied, \"I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples."

The day was really quite beautiful, and the drink facilitated some deep thinking.\n\nMy wife walked by and asked me what I was doing, and I said, \"nothing\". The reason I said \"nothing\" instead of saying \"just thinking\" is because she then would have asked, \"About what?\" At that point I would have had to explain that men are deep thinkers about various topics, which would lead to other questions.\n\nFinally I pondered an age old question: Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts? Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts, but how could they know?\n\nWell, after another beer, and some more heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with an answer to that question. Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby, and even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion. A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, \"It might be nice to have another child.\"\n\nOn the other hand, you never hear a guy say, \"You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.\"\n\nI rest my case. Time for another beer, and then maybe a nap."

An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets and bars of Soho one sunny afternoon.\n \nWalking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window:\n'Pianist wanted for evening performances'.\n \n\"Fucking get in there you cunt!\" he says to himself and goes to the bar.\n\"Get the fucking manager of this pigshit middle class wank pit please you cock sucking cunt\", he says to a somewhat startled barman.\nThe barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs.\n\"Can I help you sir?' he says.\n\"Yes you can you fucking fat assed piece of shit, I saw your shitty advert in the cunting window and I'm here to fucking audition. Wanker!\"\n \nThe manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic.\n \nAt the end the thrilled barman cries,\n\"Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?\"\n\"That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' \"\n\"Oh\" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, \"err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?\"\n\"Fucking wanker...\" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears.\n \nThe manager, through his teardrops asks him the title.\n\"That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' \"\n\"I see\" says the manager. \"Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?\"\n\"Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' \".\n \n\"Look,\" says the manager, \"I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience.\"\n \n\"Fuck it\", says the pianist, \"why cunting not?\"\nOn his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage.\n \nDuring the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act.\n \nAfter the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him.\n\"Hi\" she says.\n\"Oh, hello\" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.\nShe leans over and whispers in his ear,\n\"Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?\"\nPlacing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says,\n\"Know it? I fucking wrote it!!"

The man is dressed in an expensive suit, has a beautiful supermodel hanging off each arm, and has a limo parked outside. Furthermore, the man has an orange for a head.\nThe customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every woman in the joint, despite having an orange for a head.\nThe bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man's life.\n\"Excuse me,\" says the bartender, \"I can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistible to women, but you have an orange for a head. How did that happen?\"\nSo the man told his story.\n\"A while back, when I was penniless, I was walking along the beach and saw an old lamp, half buried in the sand. I picked it up and gave it a clean, and POOF! out popped a genie. The genie explained that he had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so grateful to me for freeing him that he would give me three wishes.\n\"For my first wish I asked for an unlimited fortune. The genie said 'It is done!' and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there.\n\"For my second wish I asked for the attention of all the most beautiful women in the world. The genie said it was done, and since then I have been able to get any woman I wanted.\nThe bartender, amazed, couldn't hold in his excitement any longer \"And the last wish?\" he asked.\n\n\"I asked to have an orange for a head, obviously."

Our man goes to sleep, enjoying the quiet.\n\nWhen he wakes up in the morning, the others are gone. A note is left on the table. “Comrade! A couple of your jokes yesterday would easily get you to Siberia! (The one about Stalin’s maid, while hysterical, could get you in front of a firing squad!!!) However, we liked that room service joke so much, we’ll let you off the hook this time. Sincerely, KGB.”"

There's a metaphor in all of this, a twisted, black pearl that adorns my story, the Raven to my Poe, but eighty-eight days later, the poetic nature of the moment eludes me. I see nothing. I hear nothing. I feel nothing. Eighty-eight days of nothing.\nI still remember that day, and in such precise detail. It's unnerving. If events had gone differently, if that fateful day had been just another day in the life, i doubt i'd remember every subtle contour of the painting that I glanced at, in that bustling cafe. The dull minty tingle of the tea i drank while sitting there at 8:04. The sweet aroma that filled the cafe that morning could have been just another detail, but somehow i remember it so vividly, so vividly that every morning it's that subtle smell that starts me from the darkness of my slumber to the darkness of my cell. Somedays I wake up wondering if i had this coming. Most days I wake up knowing I did.\nI suppose identity is more than just power. Power can be assumed, usurped and gambled away, but identity is something so much more, something timeless. I've fought mine for so long now that I can't remember the last time I looked in a mirror and recognised the face staring me back, dead in the eyes. Windows to my soul? Hardly. Placards of my identity? Thats an altogether more terrifying idea. These eighty-eight days could be the final stretch of that battle. For all I know this is only the beginning.\nEighty-eight days I've been trapped here, and yet perhaps trapped is the wrong word. Can I really play the prisoner to my own warden?\nI sealed my fate, and I now know that. Eighty-eight days ago, I did not. Eighty-eight days ago, my world was a brighter place. The lights are off now in my cell, and yet now, things are brighter than ever. \"Once I was blind, but now I see.\" The truth is apparent, and I cling to that final triumph. Sanity slips away. Lights fade away. But Eighty-eight days later, I see what I've been missing. My cell walls fade away, and suddenly all is clear. The darkness is gone, and all is clear. I see all. I know all. All is clear. Eighty-eight days ago, my sister placed me in a shoe box, and in doing so, freed me. Vilification is the purest form of acceptance. The irony there escapes me. Breath escapes me. Life itself escapes me. I myself. Escape. Me.\nEighty-eight days ago, my sister placed me in a shoe box. Eighty-eight days later, I realise the truth.\nI am a pair of nikes. All is still. Eighty eight days later, I am a pair of nikes. I  know that now. I cherish that now. I am a pair of nikes. I am a pair of nikes. The screen fades to black. I am a pair of nikes. The curtain falls. I am a pair of nikes. Children cry themselves to sleep, fathers walk out on families, wars break out, and the world breaks down. I am a pair of nikes.\nI am a pair of nikes.\nIam apair ofnikes.\nIama pairofnikes.\nIamapairofnikes.\n...Nike\nJust do it.\nTL;DR: Man in cafe. Then is shoe."

      "full_joke": "Pink ping pong balls A day before his 15th birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' \n\nThe son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. \n\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' \n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. \n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' \n\n`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. \n\n`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n\n`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' \n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' \n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \n\n`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. \n\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. \n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. \n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. \n\n`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' \n\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. \n\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. \n\n`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' \n\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker. \n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. \n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. \n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' \n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\n`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. \n\n`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe son nodded weakly. \n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. \n\n`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. \n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. \n\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. \n\n`I- I-' \n\nThen he died."

He stands up, and with as strong a punch any octogenarian can muster, he hits the guy as hard as he can, and storms out.  \n\nStunned, the guy recomposes himself.

He chose her because she came highly recommended by his family doctor and he was unaware of her prettiness until he first saw her. Despite the urologist's beauty and the fact that her lubricated and gloved finger was the first time that anything was put into this man's anus (he is on the prudish side of sexual activity and has swatted away a few attempts by girlfriends throughout his life to stimulate his prostrate while performing fellatio on him) he found that her utterly professional and calm demeanor put him at ease and he did not feel nearly the shame and humiliation that he was dreading once he realized that this beautiful woman would be the one examining him. The doctor was pleasantly surprised to find that the man's sphincter was relaxed and his prostate was easier than normal for her to examine. When they were done, and he rearranged his examination gown. The doctor noticed that he had an attractive face and athletic build and she found herself growing aroused. However, she wanted to respect the man's obvious discomfort and embarrassment, and so she retained her friendly, yet professional demeanor and refrained from doing anything that could possibly be construed as flirting. Like the patient, the doctor was also recently divorced, and when she went home that night she thought longingly of meeting a man with a face that was as kind and bashful face as his. When the man went home that night he thought of the beauty of this urologist and wondered if he would ever meet her in a social situation where he could see if his reasonably competent pick up game was strong enough to overcome the uncomfortableness of this exam and ask her out. However, none of this would matter, as the biopsy results of this exam would show that the man had stage 2 prostate cancer which would metastasize soon after and he'd spend the next six months undergoing chemotherapy and surgery to remove his prostate and these would be his last six months on earth as he would die alone 50 pounds lighter. His ex-wife would be the sole attendee of his funeral, she would not cry.\n\nif this amused you, [I'm on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lebovitzben)"

He knew that the fox did it and the bear didn't catch him so he had it going for him. Alas, the police-bear happened to be in the vicinity of the crime. He didn't see it happening but let me tell you he had a nose for these kind of things, he even caught a pair of birds shitting off of a tree branch.\n\nNow, the police-bear approaches the rabbit *\"Did you shit in the woods, rabbit?\"*\n\nThe rabbit quickly covers his misdoing with his hat. *\"No, sir, but as others might say, does the bear shit in the wood\"*\n\nRather angrily and not amused the police-bear answers *\"Don't play smartass with me, I saw you covering your shit with your hat\"*\n\n*\"But sir I mean it, I have not shat here. You see I was catching a butterfly, that's what I covered with my hat\"*\n\n*\"Then lift your hat\"*\n\n*\"No can do, it will fly away\"*\n\nThe police-bear thinks, this rabbit won't outfox him like the fox did earlier. He readies his pistol and shoots a couple of rounds at the hat. \"Now it won't fly away, lift your hat\"\n\n*\"Aye, sir\"* and the rabbit slowly raises the hat, and as the police bear sees the shit beneath, the rabbit exclaims in a high pitched voice:\n\n*\"**Fuck, bear, you shot the living crap out of it!**\"*"

He is happy to find the bus goes express, and he gets to his apartment building in record time. He walks up the four flights of stairs, thinking about how lucky he is to see his wife and drink a cold beer. He reaches his door but finds it locked. He knocks, and as he leans in he hears his wife moaning, along with the sounds of some guy. Well, he goes red with rage and starts pounding on the door. After a minute his wife opens the door, a blanket wrapped around her naked body. \"It's not what you think!\" she screams, but he ignores her, pushing past to see if he can find the guy. The apartment is only one room, with a bathroom off to the side, so there's not a lot of places to hide. The husband looks under the bed, peeks into the shower, but can't find the guy. Then he notices the window is open. He runs over, looks out, and sees a guy in his shorts hanging from the window below him. The husband starts yelling, \"I'll kill you!\", pulling tools off his belt and throwing them at the guy, until the guy suddenly loses his grip and falls. But since the fall is only three stories, when he lands he only breaks his legs. The husband is furious. He looks around for something to throw, and the closest and biggest thing he finds is the fridge. He pulls it to the window and then pushes it out, and it falls right on the guy, killing him instantly. However, in doing this, the husband works himself up so much he has a heart attack and also dies. \n\n\nThe next thing he knows the husband is standing in line at the pearly gates. Saint Peter beckons him forward and asks, \"Well my son, how did you die?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replies the husband \" I came home from a hard day at work and found my wife cheating on me. I was so angry that when I found the guy hanging outside the window I threw things at him until he fell. However, he only broke his legs, and I wasn't satisfied, so instead I grabbed the fridge and pushed it out onto him. But in doing this, I had a heart attack, and here I am.\"\n\n\"Oh boy.\" Replied Saint Peter \"Well, while I'm sad that your wife was not true, it is wrong to kill. I'm afraid you have to go to hell.\" With that, the husband is ushered off to hell. \n\nSaint Peter looks at the next man in line and beckons him forward. \"And how did you die, my son?\"\n\nThe guy looks perplexed. \"It was the strangest thing, sir.

Well, I was doing this like normal, when all of a sudden a crazy guy starts throwing things at me. I lost my grip and fell, and somehow by God's grace, I didn't die! I started thanking God, but then the guy suddenly pushed out a fridge, and it landed directly on me!\"\n\nSaint Peter scratches his head. \"I am sorry, son. You lived a good life, and as a reward, you get to go to heaven.\" And with that, the guy is ushered to heaven. \n\nSaint Peter beckons the next person in line, who walks up. \"How did you die, my son?\"\n\nThe man replies, \"Well, picture this: You're hiding in a fridge..."

I screwed up enough courage to smile at her and say hello. Apparently that was enough for her to take interest, and even though I wasn't that into her once the initial novelty wore off, we spent the next few months dating.\n\n3 months later, it turns out that she's a virgin, and we still have not sealed the deal. This was fine with me, I was patient and respected her choices. At the end of one particularly memorable date, I pulled up in front of her house to drop her off and she leans over and kisses me before getting out of the car. I decided to go for broke and grabbed the back of her head, continuing the kiss a lot longer than usual. Things began to get hot and heavy and I could tell she was into it, but she was also incredibly nervous.\n\n\"I'm sorry Ender, I have to go, my grandmother's waiting for me inside.\"\n\n\"That's cool, can I meet her?\"\n\n\"Ummmm, sure, I guess....\"\n\nSo we go inside and introductions are made. We chat for a while and grandma tells me stories, like what Christmas was like in the 40's. I make Grandma laugh several times and she ends up adoring me, as most Grandmas do.\n\nFinally it was time to go. I said goodnight, and it was then that she smiled at me, winked, and nodded her head towards the stairs. I was totally expecting to just head home as usual, but it looked like my charm lit a fire in her and the situation was about to change for the better!\n\nWe eventually make it up to her room, and while she was incredibly nervous, I finally got her completely naked and things really started getting wild at that point. I never expected it, but she was a complete animal! That night may have been the best sex of my life.\n\nAt one point she stops me and says \"Maybe we should take a break.\"\n\n\"Why, is everything ok? Did I hurt you?\"\n\n\"No it's not that, it's just that I think I hear my granddaughter crying downstairs, and I really don't want to deal with that again tonight."

Knocking on the door, he is greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long gray beard. \"I'm lost,\" said the young man. \"Can you put me up for the night?\" \"Certainly,\" the Chinese man said, \"but on one condition. If you lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\" \"OK,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old, and entered the house. \n\nDuring dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. During the night, he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet, so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. \n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes, he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\" \"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought.\"If that's the best the old man can do, then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window, and threw the boulder out. \n\nAs he did so, he noticed another note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. \n\nAs he plummeted towards the ground, he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bed post."

They do some routine work, collecting rock samples, checking temperatures and the like.\n\nThen one of them sees a man in the distance sitting on a deck chair wearing a handkerchief with knots on each corner on his head licking an ice cream. He turns to the other astronaut and says \"Who the hell is that!\". So they go over and one of the astronauts asks \"Who are you!?\" to which the man replied \"Can't you see? I'm God!\". \n\n\"Well God, what are you doing here in such a desolate place like the moon?\" said one of the astronauts.\n\n\"I'm on holiday! Can't you tell?\" replies God.\n\n\"Well why the moon?\" said the astronaut.\n\n\"Well it's like this, last year I went to Mars: All these funny little green men running about all over the place, I didn't like it. The year before that I went Venus: Far too hot.\" Says god.\n\nNow this astronaut had an idea, he thought \" If I can get him to come back to Earth with us I might be able make some money out of this, play it of as the second coming off Jesus!\"\n\nSo the astronaut asks God \"Why don't you come to Earth, it's much nicer down here there's warm blue sea's and blue skies and long golden beaches - a beautiful planet! I can give you a lift!\"\n\nTo this god tells them \"Earth! Don't talk to me about that place! I went there over 2000 years ago, got some woman in the pudding club and they're STILL talking about it now!\"\n\n\n*I've more or less transcribed this for you word for word but my dad's British and didn't say 'got her pregnant' instead he said 'got her in the pudding club' which I have no idea if people outside the UK will know what that means but he was adamant that it stayed in.*"

None of them will have any smaller bills and none will admit they want change back.\nWhen Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice get their bill, out come the \npocket calculators.\n\nMoney\n===========\nA man will pay $10 for a $5 item he needs.\nA woman will pay $5 for a $10 item that she doesn’t need, because it’s on sale.\n\nBathrooms\n===========\nA man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, razor, shaving cream, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Motel 6.\nThe average number of items in a woman’s bathroom is 284. The average man would not be able to identify most of them.\n\nArguments\n===========\nWomen always have the last word in an argument.\nAnything a man adds after that is the beginning of a new argument.\n\nCats\n===========\nWomen love cats.\nMen may say they love cats, but when women are not looking, will men kick cats.\n\nThe Future\n===========\nA woman worries about the future — until she gets a husband.\nA man never worries about the future — until he gets a wife.\n\nSuccess\n===========\nA successful man is one who makes more money than can be spent by his wife.\nA successful woman is one who can find that a man.\n\nMarriage\n===========\nA woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn’t.\nA man marries a woman expecting that she won’t change, and she does.\n\nDressing Up\n===========\nA woman will dress up when she goes shopping, empties the garbage, answers the phone, waters the plants, gets the mail and reads a book.\nA man will dress up for weddings and funerals.\n\nNatural\n===========\nMen wake up looking as good as when they went to bed.\nWomen will somehow deteriorate during the night.\n\nChildren\n===========\nA woman knows all about her children. She knows about their best friends, romances, secret hopes and dreams, favorite foods, fears and dental appointments.\nA man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.\n\nMaturity\n===========\nWomen mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can function as adults. Most 17-year old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.\n\nHandwriting\n===========\nTo their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken-scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their “i’s” with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their “p’s” and “g’s”. It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she’s dumping you, she’ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.\n\nGroceries\n===========\nA woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett’s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 12-items-or-less lane.\n\nGoing Out\n===========\nWhen a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she WILL be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earrings and finishes putting on her makeup.\n\nLow Blows\n===========\nLet’s say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says, “Oh, gee. That must have hurt.” The man groans and doubles over, and actually FEELS the pain.\n\nLaundry\n===========\nWomen do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat.\n\nThe Wedding\n===========\nWhen reminiscing about weddings, women talk about “the ceremony”. Men talk about “the bachelor party”."

We had to keep his eyes irrigated and shielded from light while they searched for a pediatric plastic surgeon who could correct it.\n\nFortunately one of the top surgeons in our region was available. When our attending physician explained the situation to him, he asked, \"Has the patient been circumcised yet?\" Our doc replied that he hadn't, and the surgeon explained his plan.\n\nThe NICU cut a short length of 5mm silicone tubing and placed it over the tip of our newborn's penis, then carefully stretched his little foreskin over the end of the tubing and taped it in place. After 12 hours they replaced it with 7.5mm tubing, then after 24 hours they replaced that with 10mm tubing.\n\nThe next day the surgeon arrived. They wheeled our baby into surgery where he performed the circumcision and then immediately used the recovered, stretched tissue to replace the missing eyelids.\n\nAfterward, the surgeon explained to us that he's done this surgery only three times before but it was always successful, and since it used the baby's own tissue there was virtually no chance of rejection.\n\nWe thanked the surgeon and asked if there were any side effects we should look out for.\n\n\"Well,\" he said thoughtfully, \"he'll probably be a little cockeyed."

His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! \n\nUnable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: \n\n\"Master, Master! ...

She takes a big swing and hits the ball, the ball soars in the air and goes through a window of a mansion which happens to be at the resort. \"Shit, we have to go apologize\" says the husband. The wife agrees and they both decide to go to the mansion. As they find themselves at the front door the husband decides to knock on the door, as he knocks the door creepingly opens up slowly. \"Should we go in? Doesn't look like anyone's here\" says the wife. The husband says \"yes let's go in and retrieve the golf ball and pretend it wasn't us that broke the window.\" They go inside looking at room after room until they find the room with the broken window, golf ball on the floor and knocked over lamp. The husband decides to pick up the lamp and out of no where a genie appears. The husband and wife are both shocked but the genie says \"don't be scared, you have saved me, I was stuck in this lamp for centuries, I will offer you both a wish, any wish you would like but there is one request I have.\" The husband says what is that request? The genie responds and says \"I get to have one wish of my own after I have granted your wishes.\" \nThe wife says \"OK no problem, my wish is that I have 10 million dollars\" the genie snaps his fingers and says 10 million dollars is in your account. The husband says I want a Ferrari and Lamborghini, the genie snaps his fingers and says as soon as you go outside you'll see your cars. Both of them are so excited and then the genie interrupts and says \"now it's time for my wish, I wish to have sex with your wife. The husband says \"No way\" but the wife agrees to it and says we will get our wishes if I do so and that there is no problem. The husband agrees and the wife goes to another room with the genie. During sex the wife asks the genie \"how old are you genie?\" the genie responds by asking her how old her husband is. She says my husband is 40 years old. The genie replies, so your husband is 40 and still believes in genies?"

Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.\n \nAnd she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\n \nAnd Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, dear?\"\n \nAnd Dot replied, \"I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\"\n \nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums.  And the drums rang out and were an immediate success.  Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.\n \nTo prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew.  It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP).\n \nAnd the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.  They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS.  And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks.\n \nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others.\" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known.  He said, \"We need a name that reflects what we are.\"\n \nAnd Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\"  \"YAHOO,\" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.\n \nAbraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside.\n \nIt soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE).\n \nThat is how it all began. And that's the truth."

Every night, the same guys would turn up, have a few pints of beer, share a conversation and the occasional game of darts or dominoes. At 8pm every night, Ted would receive a visit from one of his other regulars - Champ, a stray dog who always came for a bowl of water and a few bags of pork scratchings. The regulars all loved Champ, and he was treated like the pub's mascot. \n\nOne night just before 8pm, there was a screech of brakes outside the pub, shortly followed by a man running into the pub in a state of distress. \n\n\"This dog, it just ran out in front of my car...I think I've killed it!\"\n\nTed immediately feared the worst, and sure enough when he went outside, it was the heavily mangled remains of Champ in the middle of the road. Only Champ's tail remained intact. \n\nTed and the other regulars were in shock, but soon decided that they should have some kind of tribute to such a well-loved regular of the pub. \n\n\"Why don't we get his tail stuffed, and hang it above the bar?\" suggested one of the regulars. This was thought to be a great idea, and shortly after a taxidermist was called and Champ's tail was stuffed.\n\nOn New Year's Eve that year, Ted was having a quiet drink after having closed the bar at the end of a successful evening. All of a sudden, he heard some scratching noises coming from the front door. \"That sounds like Champ!\" thought Ted, but one glance at the tail above the bar told him it couldn't be. He looked into his drink, shook his head and carried on drinking. \n\n10 minutes later, he heard the same scratching noises. This time, he couldn't shake off his curiosity and made his way to the front door. When he opened the door, he recoiled with a huge fright; there in front of him was the ghost of Champ on the door step, looking up at him. \n\n+I'd like my tail back, please+ came this voice inside his head.\n\n\"I...I...I can't d-d-d-do that!\" stuttered Ted. \n\n+I'd like my tail back, please+ repeated the ghostly form of Champ. \n\n\"I can't do that\" replied Ted, having overcome his original shock. \n\n+I have come seeking the return of my tail. I cannot transition through to the afterlife in such an incomplete state. Why can I not have my tail back?+ insisted Champ. \n\nTed glanced at the clock. It was now 3:30am. \n\n\"I'm sorry, but we can't retail spirits at this time of night."

I'd like to tell you a little-known, but inspiring and true story that involves my friend Jake's grandmother.\n\nHer name was Erica. She lived a typical grandmother life, knitting, spoiling her grandchildren and puttering around.\n\nBut despite having lived a full life before retiring, she wanted something more. So she decided to take her love of gin and turn it into a hobby. Erica painstakingly researched different recipes for gin, mixed them with her cooking expertise, and experimented for months with different ratios, strainers and ingredients.\n\nAfter many months of working on her various gins, one of her friends, Stacy, came over to her house one night and happened to try one of the drinks. Stacy found it so delicious that she suggested that Erica should try selling some of her various flavors of gin. Erica did just that, starting at the local farmer's market, and when her popularity increased, she began mass producing her most-loved flavors of gin.\n\nErica's gin quickly became hailed as one of the best-grade gins in the world, earning awards and feature articles in popular publications.\n\nIt wouldn't last though. Erica's life was tragically cut short by a heart attack, and with her death came the death of her secret recipes. Many people would try to recreate Erica's gin for years to come, yet no one could find the proper mixtures of ingredients.\n\nBut Stacy, the one who pushed her to start her business, never gave up. She searched and searched, looking through purchase logs and transactions for the suppliers of Erica's juniper berries, malt, and other ingredients. Stacy worked nights and weekends for months on end, ardently refining her product, until, amazingly, she came across the perfect recipe. Erica's original gin recipe. It tasted exactly like the first gin Erica had made that fateful night years before. Stacy brought the original Erica brand of gin back to the world, and gin-lovers the world over rejoiced at her work.\n\nThe moral of this story is thus: With hard work and perseverance, you too can Make An erica Grade-A gin."

She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, \"Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?\" The blond replies.....\"Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"

How much did you spend?'\n\nTo her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'\n\n'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.\n\n'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'\n\n*'So I just switched the heads.'*"

But I would never pursue a student sexually or romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.\n\nShe wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.\n\nSo a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. \n\nThe father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, \"And what did you even expect would come of something like this?\" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: \"About tree fiddy.\" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, \"Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!\"\n\nTL;DR Teenage girls are crazy"

The leprechaun orders a beer and chugs it as soon as his gets it. Turns towards the biker and spits in his face. The biker is pissed says \"the fuck is your problem\". The leprechaun orders another drink, chugs and proceeds to spit in the bikers face again. The biker stands up this time and yells \"do it again and I'll cut your dick off\". The leprechaun calmly looks up at the towering figure of the biker. Turns and orders another drink. Watching him carefully with fury filled eyes the biker takes a huge glob of spit right between the eyes. He grabs the leprechaun by the neck and pulls a knife from behind his back. Says to the little man \"I'm cutting it off you little prick\". The leprechaun smiles and says \"Sorry for you boy, but I don't have a dick\". \"How do you piss then\" the biker asked confused. The leprechaun then spits in his face again."

      "full_joke": "A gorilla that swung too far A zoo was barely making ends meet. The head zookeeper was keeping things together, but it was a struggle. Instead of a pride of lions, they had one lone lion. Instead of a band of gorillas, just two. The rest of the zoo animals were just as sparse.\n\nOne day during a thunder and lightning storm, a single bolt of lightning struck the two remaining gorillas and killed them both instantly. Thankfully due to the storm, there were no people visiting the zoo and so the general public wasnt aware of the tragedy. The head zookeeper pulled a staff member aside and said \"Hey, I've got a gorilla suit in the back. Why dont you put it on every day, get in the habitat and act like a gorilla and I'll see that you get paid an extra $50 a day.\"\n\nThe staff member agreed, and everything seemed to be working out fine. The public thought it was an authentic gorilla, the staff member made an extra $50 a day and the zoo didnt have to go through the trouble of finding a new gorilla plus deal with the financial hassle of maintaining a real animal.\n\nThe staff member realized one day that he could swing on the artificial vines on the tree in the habitat. He got quite good at it, and would at times swing out so far that he would leave the gorilla enclosure. The head zookeeper didnt care because he knew the gorilla was really a man in a gorilla suit, so he let it continue. The public loved it, thinking that a real gorilla was actually getting out of the enclosure, it heightened their sense of enjoyment.\n\nOne fateful day, when the staff member gave a particularly vigorous swing, his momentum carried him quite far out of the range of the gorilla enclosure. In fact, he realized he was directly over the lion habitat. At that moment, the artifical vine snapped, and he tumbled down through the air. He landed flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him.\n\nThe lone lion saw the gorilla fall, and sprang over with a roar. The man in the gorilla suit was terrified, and as his breath returned to him, he began to yell for help. \"SAVE ME!!! I'M NOT A REAL GORILLA!!!\" he yelled. At that moment, the lion moved his jaws towards the monkey head, opened his mouth and said...\n\n\"Shut up you idiot, or we will both lose our jobs!"

      "full_joke": "The Tramps Holiday There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\n/ till the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\n.' '.\n. .\n. .\nhe jumped.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n:\nSlowly at first,\n:\nbut speeding up,\n:\n:\n:\nfaster, and faster,\n:\nspeeding past Pluto,\n:\nand the other outer planets,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\nI'm a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI've been through many a hard ship in my life."

His room (and any room for that matter) wouldn't be available until tomorrow. The receptionist told the man that if he asked nicely he might be permitted to stay one night in the local temple along with the monks. So the man made his way to the temple. Once there he was greeted by an old monk. \n\n\"Good evening.. ehm.. sir? Something went wrong when booking my hotel. Could I possibly stay here for just one night?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said the monk. \"We have a room just for tourists like you, we can even offer you some food in the morning. However, I must warn you. You may wake up in the middle of the night hearing a strange sound.\"\n\n\"What strange sound?\" the man asked monk, now very curious as to what this might be about.\n\n\"I wish I could tell you\", said the monk. \"But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.\"\n\nAlthough bummed out, the man didn't think much of it. I mean, he got what he wanted. A place to spend the night, and that's all you can ask for. But when he awoke in the middle of the night to the strangest sound he had ever heard in his entire life his curiosity creeped back to him. He NEEDED to know what this unearthly sound was. So when the monk came with his food in the morning he asked him again. \n\n\"I'm sorry\", said the monk. \"But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.\"\n\n\"Ok, then I want to become a monk\", said the man.\n\n\"Becoming a monk is not easy, it requires much dedication and many can't do it.\"\n\n\"I'll do whatever it takes, like, absolutely anything. I NEED to know the source of this sound.\"\n\n\"Very well\", the old monk seemed pleased with the answer. \"To become a monk, you must travel the world and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Once you do that, you become a monk.\"\n\nThe man walked out of the temple. His journey had now begun. He started traveling all across the world. Counting every blade of grass and every grain of sand. \nMany, many years later he returned to the temple. The old monk were, to his surprise, still alive, waiting for him on the top of the stairs to the temple. \n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"I counted it to 56738370921 blades of grass, and 27489173408820 grains of sand!\" the man said with triumph on his face.\n\n\"I can see your dedication. Congratulations, you are now a monk.\"\n\n\"So... I get to see the source of the sound?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may. Follow me please.\"\n\nSo he followed the old monk. Through the temple and into a tiny room at the back. The only thing housed in this room was a large wooden door.\n\n\"Behind here, is the source of the sound\", said the monk.\n\n\"FINALLY!\" the man thought to himself. \"I FINALLY get to see the source of the sound.\"\nHe walked up to the large wooden door, filled with anticipation. He placed his hand on the handle and slowly opened the door. \n\n\nAnd what was behind the door? I would tell you, but only monks are allowed to know the source of the sound."

Just stick your dick in there and you will feel better. The new lumberjack was put off by this idea and decided to pass. But, after a few more weeks he was getting antsy and decided to make the hike to the tree. When he gets there he sticks his dick in and is amazed, it feels just like fucking a woman. He was instantly hooked. He started visiting the tree every night, sometimes more then once and would just go to town fucking the shit out of that tree. One night on one of his trips he sticks his dick in and nothing happens, it feels like just sticking his dick in a wood hole. He goes back to foreman and tells him he thinks the tree is broken.

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nI guess it wasn't the same elephant."

      "full_joke": "The camping story A couple of years ago I went out camping in the woods with a few of my friends. It was a dark and stormy night, and we felt very alone in our little tent, so we started telling scary stories.\n\nI described how the hills we were in used to be coal mining country, and the coal mines were dark and dangerous. If you didn’t die from coal lung you’d die from cave-ins, and if you didn’t die from either of those, you’d starve to death on the miniscule wages they paid you. The mine just up the hill from us was the worst. The manager had an extortion racket that he was keeping hidden from the owners - he would demand a “tribute” of 50% of the day’s wages from each of his miners, or he would think up a reason to get them fired. Pay was starvation level even without giving the manager his cut, and so after a few months of this tribute the miners became pale, sickly, and emaciated. Paradoxically, they started working harder and harder, hoping they would strike it rich enough to get a bonus that they could use to get out of that awful place.\n\nOne of the miners worked even harder than the others. He just kept digging and digging, and when he looked back, he’d gone too far, left everyone else behind, and couldn’t find his way back. Life out there was so bad he found he barely cared. He just kept digging and digging and digging, figuring that working himself to death was as good a way to go as any other.\n\nFinally he came to a vein of rock darker than any he’d ever seen before, and when he broke through it - wham! - he had dug all the way to Hell. Satan came over to meet him, and told the miner that they had a problem. He couldn’t stay in Hell, because he wasn’t a sinner. But he couldn’t go back either, because the rules say no mortal may leave Hell alive. So Satan offered him a deal - he would transform the man into a vengeful ghost, who could spend eternity possessing mortals and driving them to madness.\n\nThe miner thought a bit, but he wasn’t convinced. The only guy he wanted to possess and drive to madness was his evil manager who had stolen a tribute from every one of his paychecks. After getting revenge on him, he wasn’t sure he wanted an eternity of possessing random other people. Satan suggested that maybe he could spend eternity possessing people and talking about how evil his manager was, so as to make his name forever dishonored. The man thought that was a good idea, and so with a word Satan transformed him into a spirit. He spent a while haunting his evil manager, then after that possessed random other people in the area to give monologues on how exploitative his manager’s labor practices were.\n\nAnd so, I finished, sometimes, on nights much like tonight, with groups of campers much like our own…\n\n“Hold on,” interrupted my friend. “Is this going to end with you saying that you’re possessed right now, and that’s why you’re telling us this story?”\n\n“Um,” I said…“I guess that…”\n\nJust then the police burst into our tent. “Stop right there!” said one of the officers. “You’re under arrest!”\n\n“For what?” I asked.\n\n“Possession by a miner within tent to diss tribute.”"

The oil tycoon says, \"Hell, at $100,000,000 I'll let the damn thing burn itself out and retire on what I've already made\". The next day another company shows up at his door offering to at least extinguish the fire for $1,000,000. The tycoon responds by saying, \"Hell, that might as well be $100,000,000 to me right now. I guess I'll just prepare to lose my livelihood\". The next day a flat bed truck with 12 Mexicans on the bed and 2 in the cab roll up the tycoon's driveway. The driver of the truck gets out and says, \"Hola, señor, what seems to be the problem?\" The tycoon says, \"Well if you'd open your eyes you can see what the problem is, I got an oil rig on fire and every day I get to step outside and watch my dreams and livelihood go up in flames\". The Mexican responds with, \"We can put your fire out, señor\" and the oil tycoon says, \"Name your price\". The Mexican said, \"My men and I can have this fire out in no time, Señor, and all we require is $10,000\". Ecstatic and curious to see the Mexicans try to succeed the tycoon gives them the go ahead to extinguish the fire. The driver gets in his truck and heads toward the flaming oil rig with his crew. He drives the truck straight into the inferno burning up every man on the back of the truck as it rolled through. When it reached the other side the fire was snuffed out. The oil Tycoon, completely over joyed, ran toward the truck to meet the two survivors in the cab. The two Mexicans were smoldering as they stepped out of the cab and the oil tycoon said, \"That is the damndest thing I've ever witnessed, boys, you sacrificed your entire crew to put out my fire! I didn't have an ounce of faith in you guys, but you did it! I gotta ask though, what are you planning to do with this $10,000?\" The driver said, \"First thing we are going to do, Señor, is get the brakes fixed on this truck\"."

The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. \n\nMODERN VERSION: \n\nThe ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. \n\nCome winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. \n\nCBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? \n\nThen a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with \"green bias,\" and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. \n\nKermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the \"Temperatures of the 80's.\"\n\nRichard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his \"fair share.\" Finally, the EEOC drafts the \"Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act\" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. \n\nHillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. \n\nThe ant loses the case. \n\nThe story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. \n\nThe ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of \"fairness\" has dawned in America."

He sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. \n\nThe bartender approaches and tells the cowboy, \"You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time.\" \n\nThe cowboy replies, \"Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Arizona , the other is in Colorado . When we all left our home in Texas , we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself.\" \n\nThe bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. \n\nThe cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way. He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn. \n\nOne day, he comes in and only orders two mugs. All the regulars take notice and fall silent. When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, \"I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.\" \n\nThe cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs. \n\n\"Oh, no, everybody's just fine,\" he explains, \"It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking. Hasn't affected my brothers though."

      "full_joke": "[Long] A story of how two wooden planks became best friends Once upon a time, there were 2 wooden planks. The first one was named Chad, the second was named Carter. Chad hated Carter, and Carter hated Chad even more! One day, Chad was in a bar, drinking a tequila. Carter, drunk, came over to Chad and punched him as hard as a wooden plank could. Chad got angry and retaliated, kicking Carter in the face. They got into a bloody and violent bar fight. They both got arrested. They were sentenced to 8 months in jail, and a hefty fine for damages done to the bar. While in jail, Carter and Chad found that they had many similarities, and soon became best friends in jail. When they got out, they decided to start a business together. \n3 years later, Chad and Carter's Hardware store was very successful and they were making tons of money. But, one day, they realized that one of their suppliers had stopped shipping them products! And this wasn't even the first time that they have done this! The 2 wooden planks got very angry, and decided to go give the owner of the factory a piece of their mind. They went over to the factory, which was called, \"Plank and Nail Industries.\" Chad thought that this name was a bit creepy. They entered the factory, and saw a quite normal looking lobby, with a quite normal looking wooden plank at the counter. \"Hey\", Chad said. \"We would like to speak with your piece of trash manager.\" The clerk gave them a weird look, but picked up his phone nonetheless and called him. \"Please wait 5 minutes while he comes down,\" he said. So they waited. The owner didn't come. \"Where is he?\" Carter said. \"He is a very busy man,\" the clerk replied. They waited half an hour. Then 2 hours. Eventually even the clerk seemed very confused. 4 hours later, an angry Chad shouted, \"Where is he!?\" The clerk replied \"I am really not sure. Please just wait a few more minutes.\" Chad sighed, and then looked to Carter. \"How are you feeling?\" Carter smacked his lips and said,\n\n\"I'm board"

He starts to get nervous.\n\"Want to go double or nothing?\" Grandpa asks. \"I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.\"\nThe auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.\nGrandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.\nThe auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.\n\"Are you okay?\" the auditor asks.\n\"Not really,\" says the attorney. \"This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!"

      "full_joke": "A monster in london By the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London.\n\nLondon of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216.\n\nThe first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide.\n\nBy the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames… no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source.\n\nHe, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil’s Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster’s hunger exceeded even this atrocity.\n\nOn August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast.\n\nLondon in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars… warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights.\n\nThe battle was truly a footnote to his preparation… Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose.\n\nHonorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving.\n\nThe beast broke the surface.\n\nNo human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus’ left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle.\n\nThe monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster’s eye.\n\nAngered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster’s mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now.\n\nOnce he had braced himself inside the beast’s mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust.\n\nWhen his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus’ “luck” in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus’ blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water’s rush against the beast’s exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, “August 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?”\n\nTwo weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared.\n\nThe body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus.\n\nHonorus’ solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage.\n\nA bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London’s trade after the Hiatus of the Beast.\n\nStill, Honorus has one final contribution to this history… It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus’ injuries.\n\nAfter the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought.\n\nOne week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus’ foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold.\n\nIn the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus’ sausages. And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing’s most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor:… It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames…"

He hobbles back to the pawn shop and buys a whole case of grenades. He heads back to the woods and just starts tossing them everywhere. After the smoke clears, he goes back to where the clearing used to be, hoping to find some charred fur or bear chunks to prove he's killed the bear this time.  But he feels a tap on his shoulder *again* and the bear says, \"son, you aren't in this for the hunting, are you?"

Paul has a shitty life, his wife constantly berates him, his job sucks, his boss is a bully, his car is a shitty 85 ford pinto with a cracked windshield and is in bad need of a new transmission and to top it all off he's chubby, balding, and he has a small penis. \n\nThe only thing good in Paul's life is his friend Artie.  Artie isn't the brightest bulb in the world, but he's always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade.  Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship.  Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul's best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend.\n\nArtie's life wasn't much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job.  In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie's car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn't end up with Paul's shitty wife.\n\nFor Paul's 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages (46, 45).  Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers.  \n\nOn Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t.v. to read out the numbers.  Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them.  The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05.  Both of Paul and Artie's hearts start beating, thats 200$ already.  53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46....... Paul feints.  He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars.  \n\nTwo minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul's place.\n\nHalfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain't gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul's Wife has got to go.\n\nArtie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul's wife anyway.  But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and \"Pays\" Artie to off his wife.  And they come up with a plan.\n\n40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul's front door only to find Paul's wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling \"WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!\" \"WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK?\"...... on and on she yells until finishes with \"WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE!\" and slams the door to the bedroom.  They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches.  \n\nThe next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul's wife in the morning.  Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with \"yes, dear\", \"Of course, Dear\", \"I'll get right on it Dear.\" All the while feeling like crap.  That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie \"It's a go\".\n\nWhile Paul's wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul's wife's Car and waits for her.  When paul's wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death.  At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour.  \n\nLittle does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape.\n\nArtie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well.  Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him.\n\nThe next day the paper lands on Paul's doorstep with the headline \"Artie Chokes two for a dollar at Safeway"

His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time.\n\nSo he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone's gps to find an alternate route.\n\nHe exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on.\n\nAs he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong.\n\nHe got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station.\n\nHe coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead.\n\nSo having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone.\n\nHe continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it's worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward.\n\nA bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn't the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open.\n\nHe decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house.\n\nThe man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door.\n\n\"can I help you?\" asks the butler\n\n\"yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don't have cell signal and...\"\n\n\"follow me.\" said the butler, sternly cutting him off.\n\nHe follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy.\n\nThe butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning.\n\n\"what did they say?\" asked the butler.\n\n\"they can't send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb...\"\n\n\"Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms.\" says the butler cutting him off again.\n\nHe follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms.\n\n\"geez,\" says the man, chuckling to himself, \"do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?\"\n\nThe butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom.\n\n\"we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something.\"\n\nThe butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner.\n\n\"you must never touch the pink gorilla!\" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nThe butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked.\n\nNot sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It's not like he would have found the cage by accident.\n\nHe eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn't decide if what he saw was real or not.\n\nSo he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn't want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi...\n\nSHHHOOOK BAM!\n\nHe froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.\n\nThe door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.\n\nThe gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nHe frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn't sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail.\n\nJust as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn't open for him. So he began to climb.\n\nHe got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla's cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate.\n\nRunning as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won't start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.\n\nThe gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man's cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says,\n\n\"you're it."

He goes back to the van and pulls out a long pole, a pair of handcuffs, a shotgun, and a chihuahua. He gives the handcuffs and the shotgun to the homeowner and says \"Alright, here's how this is going to work...you stand here with the chihuahua...he's a highly trained dog. I'm going to climb up the tree with my pole and knock the gorilla off that branch. When he hits the ground, that chihuahua is going to run over to that gorilla and attack his nuts.

The woman's patience is growing thin, and she begins to feel that she made a terrible mistake buying such a mean pet.\n\nFinally, one day, after an hour of trying to teach the parrot to say something nice, the parrot says, \"Shut the fuck up already, you old ugly hag!\" The woman is fed up, screams, and in her frustration, opens the freezer door and stuffs the parrot inside.\n\nThe parrot begins squawking loudly and furiously, beating his wings and making an enormous racket from inside the freezer. After about ten seconds, the noise stops. Fearing the worst, the woman immediately feels a wave of remorse and shame wash over her. She throws open the freezer door, and is relieved to see the parrot is alive and well.\n\nHe calmly steps out of the freezer, hops onto the counter, and says, \"Thank you so much for letting me out. I very much appreciate it.\"\n\nThe woman is stunned, but says, \"You're welcome.\"\n\nThe parrot continues, \"I'm sorry about my earlier behavior. If there's ever anything you need, I am at your service.\"\n\nThe woman has no idea what to make of this, but thanks the parrot all the same. There is an awkward silence.\n\nFinally, the parrot says, \"...may I ask what the chicken did?"

I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay.\n\nWell then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed by now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those headaches once a day.\n\nFortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Dept. and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.\n\nYes, mother and dad, I am pregnant. I know how very much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am now taking daily.\n\nI know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know that your oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told his father is an important gunbearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.\n\nNow that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you there was no dormitory fire; I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture; I was not in the hospital; I am not pregnant; I am not engaged. I do not have syphillis, and there is no Negro in my life. However, I am getting a D in sociology and an F in science; and I wanted you to see these marks in proper perspective.\n\nYour loving daughter,"

I'm a bit bored at the moment, so I've embellished it a bit! enjoy :)\n\nSo, this guy is hiking in the Himalayas, as you do, and, as he's hiking up the narrow, rock-strewn paths, he realises that it is getting late, and darkness comes early in the mountains, and he was still some distance from the next town. He starts walking more quickly, but it became dark and he couldn't see much in front of him. Just as the panic was setting in, he rounded a corner and lo, there was a light in the darkness. A monastery, not on any map, appearing, just as it was sorely needed.\nThe guy thankfully stumbles up to the great door and bangs on it loudly. After a short time, it slowly creaked open to reveal a large, almost jolly, monk with a huge smile on his face. \"Come in, weary traveller\", he says. Wondering how the happy monk knew English, but not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, the traveller thankfully entered the monastery.\n\"Please join us for dinner,\" the monk said, with that warming and happy smile. \"it will be, as always, a very joyous and happy occasion\".\n\"Thank you so much\" says the traveller, as he is shown to a room to refresh himself before the meal.\n\nAt the meal, held in the large Hall, with all of the monastery's inhabitants together, the traveller is seated as a guest of honour, next to the Abbot himself. Small talk ensues as they partake of the feast set before them.\nAll of the monks seem very happy and friendly. Our weary traveller is confused (thinking monasteries were supposed to be quiet, dull affairs), but again, doesn't want to ask any awkward questions, and so is happy to go along.\nAll of a sudden, one of the monks at a lower table stands up and says loudly, \"24!\". The other monks start chuckling, and nodding their heads in agreement. One or two even bang their cups on the table.\nAnother monk then stands up and says, \"37\". A bit more obvious a reaction this time - the monks chuckle more loudly, a few laughing out loud and more cup-on-table banging. Even the Abbot chuckles to himself.\nA third monk, \"65!\". Loud laughter, patting on backs, more cup on table bangings, even a few feet stompings - clearly the monks are having a  good time!\nThe traveller, however, is as confused as all hell! Just as he was about to ask the Abbot what was going on, the Abbot himself stood up and shouted \"17!\". More laughter, more appreciation, clapping and table banging. The monks were loving it!\nThe Abbot sat down, and saw the confused look on the traveller's face. \"My son\", he said. \"We love a good laugh, here at the monastery. We tell jokes at dinner time, and we all enjoy each others' company. In fact, we tell the jokes so often, that we ended up just numbering them - it makes it so much easier to just say the number of the joke. Why don't you try it?\"\n\nThe traveller thinks for a bit and then stands up and shouts out \"45\". More laughter, more feet stomping, nods of appreciation, comments of 'our guest is joining our traditions\" and that sort of thing.\nThe traveller is quite pleased with the response, and thinks to himself, \"I'll have another go!\"\nSo he stands up and shouts out \"112!!\".\nThere was a moment of shocked silence, and then a deafening roar as every monk there laughed loudly, banging on the tables, stomping their feet, patting each other on the back, pointing to our traveller in obvious appreciation. Some even wiped tears of laughter from their eyes.\nThe traveller sat down again next to the Abbot, feeling quite proud of himself and turned to the Abbot saying, \"They liked that one, did they?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" said the Abbot, \"That was a good one - they haven't heard that one before!"

As noted historian and sociologist Ian Ormwell stated, \"A joke cannot be taken at face value; all jests are subjective in their appearance and impact.\" Contrasting this view, the philosopher Ben Hoovian posited, \"All things being equal, a joke must remain in its proper context. A joke with no context is not a joke.\" The issue was finally settled by post-modernist Irma J. King, who unequivocally stated, \"It is the nature of humans to analyze, and all literature created should be subject to analysis.\" (For a more complete treatment on the subject I strongly recommend reading her seminal book \"6000 Years of Humor and Counting: Humor's influence on Human Civilization.\")\n\nAs for the original chicken joke, the most common interpretation would be to take the joke at face value: we are dealing with a \"real\" chicken and road. The humor of the joke is based on its simplicity: while most jokes rely on the extraordinary, the humor of this joke is based on the ordinary.\n\nOf course, one does not need to take the joke at face value. The chicken and the road can be viewed metaphorically. What if the chicken is a metaphorical coward, and is a human rather than an avian. The humor is then based not on the randomness of chicken desires, but becomes an example of cowardice and retreat.\nEven deeper, the road could be a metaphor for a dividing line, perhaps \"the other side\" is some kind of forbidden knowledge, perhaps even death. The simplicity of the joke reinforces the listener's ignorance; the joke raises more questions than answers. Sadly, we may never know. Obviously, more research is needed as to WHY the chicken crossed the road. But what kind of road is it? What kind of chicken is it? And if \"the other side\" is indeed death, what are the implications for our own existence?\n\nPlease review my sources for their veracity. Let me know of any discrepancies so I can further treat the topic with more accuracy."

Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants; takes hold of the boy's testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly. After a few seconds, the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last nickel, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.\n\nReleasing the boy's testicles, the woman hands the nickel to the father and walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word.\n\nAs soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her, saying, \"I've never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic.

      "full_joke": "The Cheerio Joke On a planet called Cheeriolia, the population is divided into three societal classes: Cheerios are the lower class, Applejacks are in the middle, and Fruit Loops are the wealthy elite. One cannot intermarry between classes, unfortunately, and discrimination is rampant between them. An authoritarian government keeps very close tabs on individual classes and poverty lines criss-cross through big cities. Cheerios are doomed to a certain limit of wealth, Applejacks cannot earn more than Fruit Loops, and Fruit Loops must pay even heavier taxes. Life is difficult, and each class has its own unique complaints with the way they are forced to live.\n\nA Cheerio named Joe worked at a local Wal-Mart as a cashier, a position he had held for years because his boss is a penny-pinching Applejack. One day, he was bagging groceries for a fellow Cheerio when a Fruit Loop walked through the door, frantically darting her eyes around, panting. She ran down a couple isles, found what she was looking for, and hurried to the check-out area. The Fruit Loop had jumped into the same express lane that Joe was manning. Even though the line was moving quickly, it was an especially busy day and there were quite a few people in the queue. She exclaimed,\n\n“Won’t this line move any faster?”\n\nThe Cheerio in front of her shook his head and chuckled to himself. The Fruit Loop didn’t notice. She stood with her one item tucked under her arm, glaring at the rest of the line. Five minutes later, she was at the line’s head. Joe looked at her, in awe of her beauty. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful Fruit Loop he had ever seen. His mouth fell open as she said,\n\n“I don’t usually shop here…”\n\nHer pejorative comment had no effect on Joe, who still could not believe his eyes. The Fruit Loop had to snap her fingers in Joe’s face for him to finally take her credit card. She paid and left, but Joe could not stop thinking about her. He resolved to find out who she was and make her fall in love with him. There was only one problem: he was a Cheerio, and she was a Fruit Loop—even if she *did* love him, it was against the law for them to marry. Still, the thought of love and marriage was hopeful, and it occupied his mind for the next two years.\n\nDuring those next two years, Joe never stopped thinking about the beautiful Fruit Loop. He worked as hard as he could, bought a chin-up bar to hand in the doorway of his tiny apartment, and subscribed to a gym membership. Joe lost some weight, started running in the mornings, and let his beard grow out. One day, much to his surprise, he awoke to a brand-new, hot-pink body that smelled very sweetly of apples. He had made the jump from Cheerio to Applejack! \n\nThat morning, Joe walked through the doors of the Wal-Mart and his co-workers stared at him, with their mouths agape. He continued working as a cashier, but one day the CEO of Wal-Mart fired Joe’s boss and promoted him to manager at the request of his co-workers, who knew his humble nature and diligence would help their local Wal-Mart. He doubled their pay, and even helped stock shelves when he had nothing else to do. \n\nA few months passed, and Joe still worked out after the workday ended, but he became very lonely. The beautiful Fruit Loop still was all he thought about, so he devoted even more of his time to work and committed himself to physical fitness. In his deluded aspirations, he sought to win the heart of the Fruit Loop without even knowing her name. \n\nJust as his hope was running low, the same Fruit Loop entered the Wal-Mart, again looking very rushed, and ran down the aisle frantically looking for another item. As she was running around a corner, she ran into Joe, who was carrying a stack of boxes. They collapsed onto the floor. The Fruit Loop began to shout obscenities as Joe helped her up.\n\n“Sorry, miss.”\n\nShe sighed.\n\n“No, I’m sorry. I ran into you. I should have been watching.”\n\n“I’m Joe.”\n\nHis voice quivered slightly, and he held out his hand.\n\n“Vanessa.”\n\nJoe led Vanessa to the cashiers, where he let his Cheerio employee go on break so he could check Vanessa out. He took a good look at her, and it was as if not a day had passed since he had seen her last. The only difference now was that he was a jacked-up Applejack who felt much closer to winning Vanessa’s heart. She took her item and left once again. Thoughts of marrying Vanessa didn’t leave his mind for three more years.\n\nIn those three years, Joe committed every waking moment to physical fitness. He was promoted at work and given authority over all the Wal-Marts in the tri-state area. Joe was still kind to his employees and gave them high salaries, but the economy was booming and he earned quite a bit of money without working very long hours. He attended some formal parties for Wal-Mart executive Fruit Loops and saw they way they lived, so luxuriously. Joe envied it. But all his wishes and hopes relied on his body and what he was made of. He did not lose hope. And one day, much to Joe’s glee, he awoke to a brand-new, sugar-coated, bright blue body. He was finally a Fruit Loop!\n\nThat morning, Joe walked from his penthouse flat to the office and, like he usually did, ran up the stairs. All the cubicles were full when he entered, and everyone peered over to get a look at his new body. All the Applejacks in accounting were amazed, all the Applejacks in IT were amazed, and all the Applejacks in administration were amazed. His boss, the Fruit Loop directly under the CEO, took notice quickly and put in a good word with the CFO, who put in an even better word with the CEO. Both thought very highly of Joe and both thought he would make the perfect CEO one day. No-one knew that the CFO was sleeping with the CEO’s wife, however, and when the CEO found out, he delved so deep into alcohol that the board of trustees voted to let him go and replace him with Joe. \n\nOne day, Joe was walking down the street to the office when he passed Vanessa. She had not aged one day in the last three years, and he immediately stopped to reintroduce himself. Vanessa was surprised it was Joe, because she remembered him to be a mere Applejack, but she did remember him nonetheless. He asked her out for some drinks later that night, and she agreed.\n\nLater that night, they met at a bar and got to talking. Joe discovered that Vanessa, despite her goddess-like beauty, had never been married and had only dated a couple other Fruit Loops. He was just as surprised when Vanessa said that she was interested in dating himself. Joe replied with a definite “yes” without hesitation. His dream had come true; now he was to only win her heart. When Joe got home that night, he put himself through the most strenuous workout he had ever done and fell asleep immediately after he had done his last deadlift. \n\nVanessa and Joe dated for eight months. Then, one day, on the terrace of his penthouse overlooking the harbor, Joe asked her to marry him. Vanessa screamed “yes!”\n\nOver the next eight years, Joe and Vanessa were faithful to each other. They had three healthy, beautiful children, and Joe continued working as the CEO of Wal-Mart. The company flourished and Joe was able to buy a large mansion out in the country where he hoped to raise his children. He kept the penthouse in the city in case he had to work late, but most of the time he was able to drive home and read his kids their bedtime stories. Vanessa never aged a day, and Joe loved her with all his heart. He had finally fulfilled his dream, and life was good.\n\nOne day, Joe was finished with an important meeting and decided to clock out and drive home to surprise his children. He had forgotten what time the school day ended and arrived in the early afternoon at his mansion. A sleek, black sedan was in the driveway, and Joe didn’t know whose it was. He cracked open the front door slowly, and went straight to the bedroom without calling his wife’s name. Joe had a terrible feeling in his stomach. He threw the door to the master bedroom wide open and saw Vanessa in bed with the old CFO. He screamed obscenities at him and threw him out of his house. Vanessa tried to explain that it meant nothing, that she still loved him, but Joe would have none of it. He packed a bag, booked a plane ticket, called the office saying that he was taking a brief leave of absence, and drove to the airport, distraught. \n\nHe boarded a plane destined for Hawai’i and watched as his home grew smaller and smaller in the distance. Joe decided he would stay in Hawai’i for a week to get his head straight and figure out what to do. When the plane arrived the next day, Joe found a five-star hotel right next to the beach. The view was lovely, and every morning before the sun was at its hottest, he would walk along the waves and think about his life. He was troubled, but at the same time he was proud of himself and what he had made of himself. Joe wasn’t sure what to do.\n\nOne morning, he passed a young, beautiful woman walking the other way. She was a Fruit Loop, like himself, and though she was not as pretty as Vanessa, she was still breathtaking. Joe stopped, introduced himself, and offered to take her up to a favorite bar by the beach for some fruit juice. The Fruit Loop said her name was Merlot and that she, too, was on vacation. They had a few drinks and talked all afternoon; they told each other their darkest secrets and, by sunset, Joe felt like he knew Merlot better than he had ever known his wife. As the moon was rising, they kissed under the stars, and Joe took Merlot back to his hotel room.\n\nThe next day, they both walked along the water. The passed the same bar they had stopped at the day before, and a sign hung in the window: \n\n“We’re closed for the Juice Festival on 3rd Street.”\n\nThe couple was puzzled, so the walked hand in hand to the location the sign specified. A large, frightening bouncer-Applejack stood in the doorway, so Joe gave him a tip and he let them in. The party inside was loud and exciting. Along the far wall, rows and rows of booths surrounded a buffet line. The music playing was so catchy, however, that Merlot dragged Joe onto the dancefloor. Hours passed, and they were soon tired. Looking for a place to sit, the picked a booth. They kissed again.

He came home the night before his flight out with a sex toy called Voo-Doo Dick.\n\n\"Voo-Doo Dick?\" his wife asked. \"What is that?\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" he smirked. \"Just have fun. It's special.\"\n\nThe next night, she decides to try it out. The directions read, \"Voo-Doo Dick responds to your every wish! Just say the name twice and then say where you want it to please you. To make it stop, say 'Cid Ood-Oov return,' and Voo-Doo Dick returns to its bed to sleep again.\"\n\nShe took off her clothes. To test it out, she said, \"Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Dick. My neck.\" Voo-Doo Dick began to vibrate and floated to her neck and gave her the best neck message she ever had.\n\nShe said, \"Cid Ood-Oov return,\" and Voo-Doo Dick floated back to its box quietly.\n\nShe said, \"Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Doo Dick, my breasts.\" Voo-Doo Dick once again floated to her and stimulated her nipples until she was turned on more than she had ever been.\n\nAfter several minutes of that, she said, \"Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Doo Dick... my pussy.\" Voo-Doo Dick moved down from her breasts and began to fuck her better than she had ever been before. She had orgasm after orgasm until she'd had enough.\n\nBut she couldn't remember the safe phrase to call off Voo-Doo Dick. She tried looking for the instructions, but she couldn't find the paper and the constant vibrating and intense orgasms still hitting her wouldn't let her think.\n\nFinally, she decided she had to get medical help. Voo-Doo Dick was still going at it. She clumsily put on a robe, got into her car, and headed toward the hospital to try to get it removed.\n\nShe weaved back and forth all over the highway as more orgasms overwhelmed her as she drove. A few miles from the hospital, a highway patrol car pulled her over.\n\n\"What in the world is going on with you, lady?\" yelled the patrolman when he got to her window. \"You must be drunk, weaving all over the road. All you look damn near naked.\"\n\nShe explained what happened and that she was going to the hospital for help.\n\n\"I've heard some whoppers in my day, lady, but that's the worst lie I've heard yet.\"\n\n\"But it's true! The Voo-Doo Dick won't stop!\"\n\n\"Voo-Doo Dick? Voo-Doo Dick my ass!"

After searching for a month, the optometrist had finally narrowed it down to two me who he thought could take care of his daughter.\n\nThe first man's name was Juan González. He was an incredibly talented man who would challenge people to tell him to play any tune they wanted on any instrument they wanted and he could play the song flawlessly on the spot. He was known all around the country as the man who could play any song on any instrument. The optometrist having a love of music with his daughter decided he could be a good choice as he could play any music that she wanted at any time.\n\nThe second man's name was Chu Jiang. He was born into an extremely wealthy family who passed down to him an inheritance twenty times greater than the average american's life earnings. He owned many large estates around the world that he could go to on his private airlines and owned large shares of giant companies.  Being an only parent, the optometrist had never been  able to afford much for his daughter and with this man she would never have to worry about money again in her life.\n\nAfter a lot of long hard thinking, the optometrist reached the conclusion that he should give this choice to his daughter as she is the one who will be affected by this decision the most. That night he walked into her room as she was about to go to sleep and said:\n\nYou have two options and I want you to tell me which one looks better for you,\n\nJuan or Chu?\n\nJuan... or Chu?"

Until the day in question -\" and he pauses here, noticeably upset.\n\nThe lawyer asks him to continue. \n\nHe takes a deep breath and starts again: \"On the day in question, I woke at eight, had breakfast at eight thirty, was at work at nine, finished at five thirty. But when I came home there was no dinner on the table and no sign of my wife. I went up to the bedroom and found her in bed with a strange man. So I killed her.\"\n\nThe lawyer asks: \"And what were your emotions at that time?\"\n\n\"I was furious. Enraged. Frenzied even. Completely unable to control what happened. Gentlemen of the jury, when I come home at six o'clock, supper HAS to be on the table"

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn’t stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. \n\n\nThe years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. \n\n\nSometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn’t listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers, I think I got most of them back in!"

      "full_joke": "Two boys walk into a pet shop. There were two young boys in a pet shop. One named Derek, and his older brother Patrick. They had been given money by their father to buy themselves two animals—one for each of them. There was such a selection! Dogs, cats, caterpillars, giraffes, parrots, and more. They could only afford two of the smaller animals, and so they were browsing the section dedicated to these.\n\nFirst they looked at the birds. There were parrots. The boys had heard that they could speak, but when they tried to converse with them, the parrots neglected to do so in a way that satisfied the boys.\n\n“Hello, Mr Parrot. How are you doing on this fine afternoon?” asked Derek, enthusiastic about the chance to see such a wonderful creature in action.\n\nThe parrot looked at him, and to Derek's disappointment, the parrot said “Fuck off, I'm trying to sleep you dickhead!”\n\nThey moved on to the next creature which was the hamster. They watched them running around and fornicating, and as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.\n\nNext was a turtle. Both of the brothers were impressed with the sight of the turtle.\n\n“There is little chance of it running away!” exclaimed Patrick, “we will never lose them!”\n\nThe turtle was reading a book, and they were curious to know what it was that the turtle was into.\n\n“I hope it's the Bible!” said Derek, excitedly.\n\nBut as they looked at it closer they came to know that it was Harry Potter and as they were close with the Lord, they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.\n\nBeside the cage that the turtle was kept in could be found a chicken. But as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so fowl. \n\nThey searched and searched through the shop and there was nothing that wasn't recklessly rubbing the Lord's face in their own sexual deviance, engagement with the Occult, or being a chicken—the greatest of all sins, committed by several of the pet shop's creatures, including the giraffe. They lamented this fact, for the giraffe appears such an innocent and sweet character! With its whiskers and tail. But alas! As the giraffe is also gravely guilty of “being a chicken,” in the Lord's eyes he is heathen and will perish the wrath of Satan.\n\nThey sought out an employee so that they might be freed of their woes. The employee was in the process of cleaning with a broom.\n\nThey said to the woman, “Can you help us?”\n\nShe turned to them and replied, “Fuck off, I'm trying to sweep you dickhead.”\n\nThen she saw the sadness and pain in their eyes and the love of God touched her heart and she had a change of mind.\n\nShe said to the boys “I will help you. What is it that you need?”\n\nDerek asked of her, “Is there any creature in this Pet Shop that is not heathen. Is there one among the animals that does not offend the Lord?”\n\nAnd understanding the boys' woes she said to them, “Yes, there is one,” and she led them to a small cage containing several beetles.\n\n“Here you will find the weevil.”\n\nAnd they marvelled at the small but innocent creature and they bought two of them and brought them home.\n\nBut their troubles were not over, for they could not tell which one should belong to whom. They decided that as Patrick was the oldest, he had a claim to the greatest of the two of them. But which was the greatest? Only a contest held between the weevils would decide the answer to this most glorious question. And so it began, the world's smallest Olympics; with few events instead of many, with beetles instead of humans, and with only two weevils from the same family, rather than a large portion of humans from many of the nations of Earth.\n\nThey decided that before they began the contest, they would name them. One of them would be called “Fermented Bovine Urine” and the other would be “Greg” for these are the names that most please the Lord.\n\nThe first contest would determine which of the beetles was superior in strength. It would be a contest of who could lift the most pianos, for the family had many pianos, and lifting pianos would be a feat of strength indeed. The creature that went first would be Greg. Greg lifted one piano and was tired after doing so. But for he was of great determination he lifted a second. And then a third. After this he apologised to the boys and said that there was no more that he could do.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine went second and it clear from the beginning that he had little capacity to lift any piano whatsoever. He was saddened by his failure and wept, for he was of inferior strength.\n\nThe next competition was to determine how each of the weevils was with navigation. So they put each in turn into a maze of the boys' own construction. Greg, once again, was first, and he finished the maze within minutes.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine was the next contestant and he was less talented with navigation than Greg was, for he could not even make it past the first alligator-pit that had been installed. He wept once more that he was not capable of defeating Greg.\n\nThe next would determine their intelligence and so they were each given the same math problem.\n\n“Surely” exclaimed Fermented Bovine Urine, “I can win this competition!”\n\nBut whereas Greg managed to provide the correct answer, Fermented Bovine Urine had merely drawn pictures of boobies for half an hour, and numbered them so that the boys might know he can count.\n\nThe next competition would determine which of them had greater musical talent. They would both sing a song for the boys, accompanied by their mother on the piano, and the boys would know who could sing with superiority.\n\nGreg chose a piece of opera, and delivered with great competence. His voice was strong, his notes were on-pitch, his technique was at a professional level. Fermented Bovine Urine chose a punk-rock song and was disqualified.\n\nThe last and most important test was the competition to see who among the beetles was closest with the Lord. Greg stood up in front of the two boys and with no reference to the Holy Book, recited the entire Bible verbatim.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine felt the Lord in his heart, but whereas Greg was greatly dedicated to his relationship with Christ, he had spent little time on it. He instead read out select passages from Chad Kroeger's Wikipedia page.\n\nIt was now decided. Patrick was to own Greg, the greater of the weevils, and Derek was to own Fermented Bovine Urine. The two boys took each of the creatures to their rooms and put them in their individual cages.\n\nThe next day they started to notice a difference in each of their lives which they knew was directly caused by the introduction of the weevils into their homes. Derek, the owner of Fermented Bovine Urine had gone to school that day and had found that whereas in the past people would ignore him, they began to notice him and celebrate his existence. He had become a greatly popular boy at his school. Derek praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.\n\nAs the owner of Greg, Patrick's experience at school that day was different. Whereas in the past he had been ignored by his peers, now they would beat the living shit out of him and call him names. Patrick was enraged that his brother had been blessed and he had not, despite him owning the greater of the pets!\n\nHe cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you allowed me to suffer this way?”\n\nBut the Lord was trolling Atheists on Reddit and did not hear him.\n\nThe next day Derek was given a gift by a generous neighbour which was a new bicycle. This bicycle was faster, easier to control and a far smoother ride than any he had ever experienced. He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.\n\nPatrick's current bicycle got run over by a car whilst he was riding it and he was given several cuts and bruises and a completely broken spine.\n\nHe cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have I been cursed so?”\n\nBut the Lord was browsing Redtube and did not hear him.\n\nA week later Fermented Bovine Urine gave Derek a hug, and Derek was pleased for he knew that his life was filled with love and joy! He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his glory.\n\nPatrick, though he could no longer move, asked Greg for a hug, but the beetle mistook his words and stabbed him with a used needle. He contracted aides, and cancer of the aides and was stoned to death for being a homosexual by the members of his church. \n\nIn his final moments he cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you blessed my brother so and cursed me when my weevil was greater?”\n\nBut though the Lord could hear him, he was disinterested in Patrick and neglected him out of indifference.\n\nYou see, my children, there is a moral here. You must always choose the lesser of two weevils."

Sometimes when I ask her questions she can't hear me. What should I do?\" The doctor replied, \"Here's what you need to do. Tonight while your wife is making dinner in the kitchen, go into the bedroom and ask her what's for dinner. If she doesn't hear you, go into the living room and ask again. If she doesn't hear you while you're in the living room, go into the dining room and ask a third time. If she still can't hear you even from the dining room, go into the kitchen and ask one more time. If she can't hear you while you're in the kitchen, then she must be losing her hearing.\"\n\nSo the man took the doctor's advice and tested it out on his wife that night. First, he went into the bedroom and called out to his wife, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" No response. So he moved into the living room. He called out again, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" No response. So he moved again, this time into the dining room. \"Honey what's for dinner?\" Still no response. So finally, he moved into the kitchen where his wife was making dinner and asked once more, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" His wife turned to look at him with an angry look on her face and said, \"Chicken.

The only interaction with the world he has is the boy who brings him his paper and groceries twice a month. After living like this for a few years he hears a knock on his door, thinking it strange as the paper boy had come just the other week he opened it with caution to see a large, hairy man standing there. He explained to the ex-cop that he was his neighbor from 20 miles down and wished to invite him to a thanksgiving party. The cop replied \"Why not, I haven't seen any other people in quite a while.\" The other man says to him \"Now I gotta warn ya, there'll be some fightin'\" the cop nodded and informed him that he had been a cop for 30 years, and it wasn't an issue. \"There'll be some eatin'\" the cop again tells him it won't be an issue. \"There'll be some fuckin'\" the cop explains he hasn't felt the touch of a woman in a while, so again no problem. With that the man begins to leave but the cop stops him, and asks him \"What should I wear?\" The man replies, \"What does it matter? It'll just be the two of us!"

My wife and I got married last summer, we were together since we were teens, she was the only person that wanted to be with me, and she was the only one I wanted to be with, other than my best friend ofcource , he’s the only other one I’d spend my time with, and it helped that my friend and my then girlfriend ( now wife ) got along very well, in fact she hung out with me because she thought my friend was cute initially ( that’s what she said ( no pun intended, or detected ( parenthesis inception ) ) )\n\nToday, I came home early from a business trip, I did not tell my wife about it, I wanted it to be a secret, I did not tell anyone about it. I wanted to surprise her, I wanted her to know that I cared about her and that I will and will always be there for her … the thing is my wife had nightmares about me being unalive and that she’d be a widow and the only person by her side at my funeral was my friend. \n\nI decided go to my best friends house, which a stones throw away from mine first, because I had the strangest gut feeling that he would be with my wife that night… Don’t get me wrong I love them both and I love the fact that they get along, but I just couldn’t get the thought out of my head, and when I went over to his … empty house, I had a moment of clarity. I was not mad, I was not angry, I was not enraged, in fact, it was all a seiner blob of thought. All  those times when he’d as us to have dinner together and I’d be the only one who’d say “no”, all those time my wife said he was a cute… \n\nAt this moment, I felt … happy . I was glad , I couldn’t believe myself. I was glad that my best friend cared this deeply about my wife, and I was glad that my wife loved my best friend this much, I was incredebally happy !!  I could now surprise them together in my own bed room !! As I unlocked my house doors, I was careful not to make a sound and wake them up, and as I walked closer to my bed room, I saw two plates in the dining area, and I opened my bed room door as slowly as I could.\n\nI was correct … My best friend was sleeping in the warm embrace of my wife, and it was so … cute, but as I took another step, the floor board creaked and my friend who had a keen ear looked around and saw me. For a moment he did not know what to do, but the very next he jolted towards me; and in the process woke my wife up. When he got close enough, he put his hands on my chest and stared kissing my all over my face, and my wife looked sheepishly at us and fell onto the bed cheekily whilst opening her arms for a hug and said “ I missed you ... “. \n\nI kissed my friend and went over to my wife and said, “ You know, I knew that you’d be with him, and I love the both of you for that”, while hugging her. My best friend joined in on the hug and I decided at that moment that he’d move in with us and would have dinner with us every night. He was now **our** best friend and the good-est boy we have ever known. We were one big happy family...\n\ntl;dr: The devil is in the detail."

And why are you buying rounds of drinks to celebrate it?\" \n\nBlond - \"Tonight is a night of wonder and celebration! I finished a puzzle tonight. On the box it said 3 years and up, but I finished it in 26 days!"

Since he was permanently disfigured, he decided to give up playing rugby for good.\n\n His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way.\n\nOne day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business. \n\nHe bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business. \n\nHe decided to employ someone to run the shop.\n\nThe next day he set up three interviews. \n\nThe first guy was great. \n\nHe knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. \n\nAt the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”\n\nAnd the man replied, “Why, yes, I couldn’t help noticing you have no ears.” \n\nThe rugby player got angry and threw him out.\n\nThe second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. \n\nHe asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?”\n\nShe replied: “Well, you have no ears.” \n\nHe got upset again and showed her the door.\n\nThe third and last interview was with the best of the three. \n\nHe was a very young man fresh out of college. \n\nHe was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business.\n\nThe rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: “Do you notice anything different about me?”\n\nTo his surprise the young man answered: “Yes, you wear contact lenses.”\n\nThe former rugby player was shocked, and said, “What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?”\n\nThe young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears!”"

      "full_joke": "The Penguin Collector So, there's this guy. This guy collects penguins. He doesn't collect penguin statues or toys or anything, he collects real, living penguins. Penguins of all sorts, Emperor Penguins, King Penguins, Little Penguins, African Penguins, all the penguins. \n\nNow, these penguins live all over his house. In his bathtub, sink, toilet, fridge, freezer, penguins everywhere. His house is practically bursting with these penguins.\n\n The mans wife is obviously not impressed with the amount of penguins her husband has.\n\n\"Honey,\" she said to him, \"You have got to get rid of all these penguins. We have no room to live. We can no longer afford to have nice things, not only do the penguins ruin everything we own, but we can hardly afford to feed the penguins. You have to get rid of them.\"\n\n\"I can't do that!\" The man replied. \"I love these penguins. They are like family to me!\"\n\n\"Either they go, or I go!\" She stated.\n\nAfter pondering this ultimatum for a while the man decides that he does, indeed, love his wife more than all his penguins put together. But what to do with all these penguins? \n\n\"Why don't you donate them to the County Zoo?\" His wife asked.\n\n\"Great idea! I'll call them tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Honey, you better call them now. I cannot go one more day with these penguins living here.\"\n\nThe man, saddened by his failed attempt to keep the penguins at least one more day, begrudgingly picks up the phone.\n\n\"Hello, County Zoo, how may I help you?\" Spoke the cheery voice on the phone.\n\n The man took a deep breath and spoke slowly. \n\n\"Hello, I'd like to speak to the person in charge of accepting donations please.\"\n\nThe receptionist on the other end of the line could hear the sadness in his voice. \n\n\"I'll connect you right away sir\" \n\nThe phone was silent for a minute. The man hoped that no one would be connected, that perhaps he could have one last day with the penguins.\n\n\"Hello, County Zoo donation office. How may I assist you?\"\n\n The man's heart sank \"Hello, I have a very large collection of penguins I would like to donate.\"\n\n\"Penguins?\"\n\n\"Yes, penguins.\"\n\n\"Like, real penguins?\"\n\n\"Yes, real penguins.\"\n\n\"That's fantastic!!\" The donation coordinator exclaimed \"We have been trying to get penguins here for a long time! We have an area all set up, but no penguins to live there!\"\n\nThe man smiled to himself. This person seemed very excited to get these penguins. At least they would be going to a happy home and they wouldn't be too far away so he could go visit. \n\n\"My wife says I need to get rid of them today\"\n\n\"Fantastic! Come on down anytime, we will be waiting!\"\n\nIt was settled. The many attached his trailer to his truck and started loading up the penguins. After spending an hour counting the penguins to make sure he had them all the man closed the trailer door and stared to drive to the County Zoo. The man got about halfway there and sure enough he got a flat tire.\n\n\"Damn it!!\" The man thought to himself. \"The County Zoo is almost closed, how will I explain to my wife if I come home with all these penguins.\" \n\nIt was at that point that the man saw another truck coming down the road. He flagged the truck down.\n\n\"Sir you have to help me! I need to get these penguins to the County Zoo. They are about to close soon and my wife will kill me if I don't take these penguins to the County Zoo today.\"\n\n\"You want me to take these penguins to the County Zoo?\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"Yes! Please! I'll pay for you to take them to the County Zoo. How about $500. Is that enough for you to take them?\"\n\nThe stranger took the money.\n\n\"Yeah, that should be enough.\"\n\nSo the two men loaded up the strangers truck with all the penguins and off the stranger went.\n\nAfter a while the man finally got his truck fixed and off he went to the County Zoo. When he got there though the County Zoo was closed. The man started banging on the gate and yelling until a security guard showed up.\n\n\"What is your problem?\" Scoffed the security guard.\n\n\"Please tell me, did my penguins arrive safely, are they all there? May I see them in their new home?\" Pleaded the man.\n\n\"Penguins? We were excepting some penguins, but we never got them.\"\n\n\"WHAT!?!\" The man was furious!! \"That jerk stole all my penguins and my $500 was a rude person!!\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir.\"\n\nThe man needed a way to blow off steam. He decided to drive around for a while before going home to his wife.\n\nAfter, maybe, 30-40 minutes the man sees the stranger from earlier. There he was. Walking down the street with a row of penguins following him, far as the eye can see.\n\nThe man slammed on his breaks.\n\nHe hopped out of his car.\n\nHe approached the stranger and said,\n\n\"Hey! Jerk! How dare you! How dare you steal my $500 and not take the penguins to the County Zoo!\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Said the stranger. I already took them to the County Zoo. I had money left over so I was taking them to the movie theatre."

The son explained the situation to the lady and told her that even though he has no money, he does have this duck. The woman thinks for a while, and decides to take the duck as payment since she knew a guy that could help her prepare the duck so that she could cook it for dinner.\n\nSo after they have sex, the woman is flabbergasted at just how magnificent the son was in bed. She even offered him a freebie but being the polite guy that he is, he refused. So the woman, desperate for another round, offered the duck back as payment, the son agrees and so they have sex again. \nLater, the son leaves the brothel with the duck. On their way back home a truck appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and hits the duck, killing it. Feeling bad, the driver offers to pay the son for the duck. Not knowing how much it was worth the son settles for $20. The driver happily obliges, pays him the $20, and they both go on their ways.\n\nFinally the son gets home when his dad asks him \"So son, how was it?\" The son replies \"I dunno dad, you tell me.\" \"Ok, so tell me what happened\" replied the dad. The son replied \"Well dad, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 20 bucks for a fucked up duck."

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.\n\nThe first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.\n\nThe next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.\nThe battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.\n\nAnd it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides."

It is breading season and some of his older bulls are having a bit of a hard time performing. These are top of the line studs, but age is finally catching up with the bulls. The farmer laments to the vet \"Well, I guess it looks like these old boys are going to be sent off to the meat packers this year\" He is none to happy, but cattle life is rough and you have to keep the herd growing. The vet looks over the older bulls \"Mmm, I don't know if they are that far gone yet, do you mind if I try something out?\" The farmer agrees and the vet gets to work. He begins working his hands into the waiting cows neither regions, getting his hands all sloppy, when he is good and dripping, he approaches the bulls and starts to smear the goop on their noses. He does this a couple times and wouldn't you know it, the bulls begin to become aroused and within moments they are chasing after the cows. The farmer is delighted and he pays the vet a little extra for the new trick.\n\nCome that evening he is laying in bed with his wife, it has been a pretty long time since they have had sex, the spirit is willing but his flesh has grown weak. As he lays there in the dark, he begins to think about his day and soon he is struck with the similarity between himself and the old bulls. So he reaches over and begins to rub his wife's vagina, brings his hand to his face, inhales deeply and repeats the process a few times. Wouldn't you know it, the old mans body begins to respond and he is elated, he hasn't been this hard since his early 30s. It is amazing!\n\nThinking that finally he can have sex again he turns on the light and begins to shake his wife awake, \"honey... HONEY... you've got to see this.... \"\n\nShe rolls over \"Ah for fuck sake, you woke me up to show me you have a bleeding nose?"

They are writing to the Hague.\n\nThe Luxemburg men are still recovering from the shock of seeing half the population of Luxembourg stranded on the island. But they will soon start collecting seashells on the beach.\n\nThe Finnish men took one look at the endless ocean, one look at the Finnish woman, and started swimming.\n\nThey were soon overtaken by the Portuguese men.\n\nThe Danish trio embarked on a search for people to join them in an orgy. They gladly accepted the participation of the Finnish woman, and are still vainly trying to persuade the Portuguese woman.\n\nThe Spanish men are protecting the virginity of the Spanish woman and are constantly suspiciously spying on one another. Meanwhile, she dances flamenco.\n\nThe Austrian men initiated a yodelling contest for the woman. The loser immediately started learning flamenco, as well as Portuguese, Finnish and Danish.\n\nThe Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.\n\nThe Swedish woman keeps on bitching about female exploitation while the men are sunbathing and waiting for her to tell them what to do.\n\nThe Irish began by setting up a distillery for which they expect to receive a substantial EU subsidy.

One night they decided to take a break and go visit the circus that just pulled into the vineyard.  \n  \nThe circus was amazing and they enjoyed a peaceful night not worrying about babies, as they were leaving they noticed a small tent off to the side and they entered it. An old wrinkly prune sat in front of a table and spoke to them \"I know what you seek, a child to call your own, I can help you but it comes at a price.\" \"Anything\" Mrs Grape replied \"we have money, antiques, anything!\" \"No, no, no, drink this potion, in 6 nights you will give birth. He will not be handsome, he will not be timid, if you can not love him, you will return to us and he will live here in the circus, yes?\" The prune asked as she handed a small bottle to Mrs Grape. Knowing she would love him no matter what he was like, Mrs Grape drank the potion.  \n \nTrue to the prunes word Mrs Grape fell pregnant, six nights later she gave birth, he was small, very dry, brown and shrivelled. Mr & Mrs Grape tried to care for the little boy, they nurtured him, stayed awake with him, gave him everything they had but he never stopped crying and once he could move he never stopped trying to destroy their house.

They locked him in the cage and moved him to the furthest part of the vineyard. For the first time in weeks they held each other and slept. In the morning with a fresh outlook they knew something was not right with their child, they walked hand in hand to the cage, ready to take him to the Prune.  \n  \nMr Grape spoke sadly \"I'm sorry buddy, we've tried, we are exhausted and I don't even think you understand us?

An elderly lady phoned her telephone company to report that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called - and that on the few occasions when it did ring, her pet dog always moaned right before the phone rang. The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile elderly lady.\nHe climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned loudly and the telephone began to ring.\nClimbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:\n1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. \n2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.\n3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.\n4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.\n5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone to ring.\nWhich demonstrates that some problems CAN be fixed by pissing and moaning."

After the formalities involved in processing, he was shown to his cell, which he had to share with another inmate. Overwhelmed by the thought of spending the next ten years in this miserable place, he spends most of the day in bed staring at the ceiling.\n\nAt 10 PM, the guards conducted roll-call, locked all the cells, and turned off the lights. Jim tried to sleep, but couldn't. \n\nAround midnight, he was snapped our of his thoughts when someone in the cellblock yelled \"TWELVE!\". Then, there was the sound of laughter reverberating around the building. He looked over to his cellmate who was laughing as well. Jim was surprised, but didn't make much of it. \n\nA little later, there was a shout of \"TWENTY NINE!\"! Again, the inmates in the block started to hoot in delight. Jim was intrigued and asked his cellmate, who was doubled over laughing, just what the heck was going on with the numbers. \n\n\"Well...\", said Jim's cellmate, \"...those numbers aren't random, man. The people in this block have been in here a long time, so long in fact, that we all know each other's jokes by heart. We numbered them so that they're easier to tell! You can shout out a number, and every inmate in this building will know what joke you're talking about!\"\n\n\"You're pulling my leg!\", said Jim. The cellmate chuckles and says, \"No, I'm not, man! Look, I'll show you. Give me a number.\" \n\nJim shrugs, \"Fine... How about 85?\". The cellmate goes to the bars of the cell and yells out \"EIGHTY FIVE!\". The whole block starts to howl out laughing. The cellmate looks at Jim and smirks. \n\nJim is astonished. \"Can I try?\", he asks. The cellmate beckons him to have at it. \n\nJim gets off his bed and goes over to the bars of the cell. \"FIFTY THREE!\", he yells. \n\nNo laughs, only silence. The cellmate says, \"Try again.\" \n\n\"SIX!\", Jim yells. Still no response. \"What happened? Did I choose the wrong jokes?\" \n\nJim's cellmate sighs, pats him on the back and says, \"It's not the jokes, buddy, you're just not telling them right."

He said if anyone could swim across the alligator infested pool and emerge unharmed he would pay them $1 million or give them his beautiful daughter's hand in marriage. \n\nImmediately after he finished saying this he heard a splash and the entire crowd watched and cheered as a young man swam quickly across the pool, thrashing and splashing, and moments later emerging from the water unharmed.\n\nThe millionaire was overcome with laughter, and with tears in his eyes said that he would honor his end of the bargain.\n\n\"Well\", he said,\"do you want the $1 million or my daughter? The young man answered, \"Sir, I don't want your money or your daughter, I just want to know who the hell pushed me into that pool!"

The sexologist gives her a viagara and tells her to slip into her husband's glass of wine at dinner time and to come back to tell her how it went. Two weeks later the woman comes back looking a little frustrated. The sexologist asks her: you don't look so pleased. Was your husband not horny enough? The woman says: oh yes he was. Right in the middle of the meal he put down his pants, violently cleared the table and fucked me so hard I'm still sore. The sexologist asks her: so what's the problem? The woman says: well, we were kicked out and told never to go back to that restaurant again."

I gave her a friendly wave and said \"hola.\" However, she kept running and didn't say anything to me. I shrugged and kept going, thinking that maybe she didn't hear me. About 10 minutes later, she caught up to me again, and I once more waved and said \"hola.\" Still, she kept her eyes straight ahead as she passed me and didn't respond. At this point, I was a little offended and felt determined to at least get a response of some kind from her.  \n\nFinally, about 10 minutes later she caught up to me again, and as she passed I said \"hola\" somewhat louder than before. She finally slowed down and turned back to me and said \"A few times I've been around this track, so it's not just gonna happen like that, 'cause I ain't no hola back girl!"
