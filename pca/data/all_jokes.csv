29802,OtherJokes,"80,000 blondes meet in a football stadium for a ""Blondes Are Not Stupid"" Convention. The leader says, ""We are all here today to prove to the world that blondes are not stupid. Can I have a volunteer?""  
  
A blonde gingerly works her way through the crowd and steps up to the stage.  
  
The leader asks her, ""What is 15 plus 15?""  
  
After 15 or 20 seconds she says, ""Eighteen!""  
  
Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 80,000 blondes start cheering, ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!""  
  
The leader says, ""Well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 80,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.""  
  
So he asks, ""What is 5 plus 5?""  
  
After nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, ""Ninety?""  
  
The leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 80,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, ""GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!""  
  
The leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, ""Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?""  
  
The girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, ""Four?""

27763,OtherJokes,"No Sex Tonight! I've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

Apparently, no sex tonight either!

18322,OtherJokes,"The Girlfriend Joke So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. 

Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?"" 

And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. 

So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, *""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""* 

""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""

So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""

So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""

So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.

A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't  miss it.""

So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""*Video Games*."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.

So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.

So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me."" 

I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow

So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again."" 

""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""

""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""

""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""

""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to *fucking murder me*.""

""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""

I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.

So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.

Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.

Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.""

15231,OtherJokes,"A man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

The lady then asks, ""And what if I come home with three men?""

He says, ""We've been as brothers for longer than I can remember, and while I was not rich in life, I would like to bring some wealth with me as I die. If you could each leave $5,000 in my coffin, it would bring me great peace.""

The three men saw no fault in this, as they were all very rich, and all upstanding members of their respective communities.

Jim was a devout, aging Catholic, and he brought the five thousand in large bills, so as not to occupy much space in the coffin. He later told the members of his congregation, and oh how they lauded him on his selflessness to ease the mind of a dying friend.

Michael was a converted Muslim, and he feared that the dead had no use for paper money, so he converted the five thousand into gold for his friend, leaving the ingots next to the bills. He felt a great warmth inside of him, a feeling that can only be brought about by a good, charitable deed.

David was born Jewish, but wasn't so devout as many of his colleagues. He refused to buck off the stereotype and worked as a moneylender, a loan agent. Because of this, he understood how exchange rates worked and how trying to convert 3 different types of money to one may be hard for a man with little experience handling cash.

8506,OtherJokes,"The Muslim Ban  Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all Muslims had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Muslim community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti didn't speak Italian, and the Pope didn't speak Arabic, they agreed that it would be a ""silent"" debate.

On the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his fingers around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy.

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God! Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won. ""I haven't a clue,"" the Mufti said. ""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him as they call it 'the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!"" ""And then what?"" asked a woman. ""Who knows?"" said the Mufti. ""He took out his lunch so I took out mine.""

Edit: First time I heard this joke was around a year ago, but I had never heard the Jewish one until shortly after.

2685,Jokes,"So a politician dies... And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.

""So, you're a politician...""
""Well, yes, is that a problem?""
""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!"" 

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician.
""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...

And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini.
""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!""
""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks.
Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...""
Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course.
""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question.
So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...

And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?""
""No sir!"" says the man.
""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"".
""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician.
""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.
""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted..."""

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.

The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia, so for the terrible crime of actually being caught consuming the booze, they are all sentenced to death! 

However, after many months and with the help of very good lawyers, they were able to successfully appeal their sentences down to life imprisonment.

The German was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: ""Please tie a pillow to my back. This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain. 

The Frenchman was next up. After watching the German in horror he said smugly: ""Please fix two pillows to my back."" But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly. 

The Englishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest in the world. For this, you may have two wishes!"" 

""Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,"" the Englishman replied. ""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""

""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.

""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really.""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.

Eventually, the three begin to bicker about which of them is the most powerful and deadly.

The youngest suddenly gets up, and flies off into the night. Almost instantly, he returns in a huge flock of bats. His hands are covered in blood.

With a cackle, he points down the road.

""You see that abandoned coach down there? I slaughtered everyone in it! The driver, a nobleman and his wife, their three sons, and a guardsman! All dead in the blink of an eye!""

The second, older than the first, but younger than the last, scoffs. ""Child's play. Watch this."" And disappears with the wind. Even with his heightened senses, the younger could not follow his movements.

The second vampire reappeared as suddenly as he had vanished, and the gust of his speed knocked the youngest to the ground. His hands, mouth, and collar were caked with gore. He gestures towards a town in the distance. As the vampires watched, a building lit on fire, and fell onto another one. Soon, the entire town was alight, but no movement could be seen from the townsfolk at all.

""A hundred people in that town! All dead! Torn to shreds!""

The youngest was in awe, but the eldest of the three only chuckled amusedly.

""How cute."" He says.

The second looks almost indignant. ""I'd like to see you do better.""

The third lets out a malevolent chuckle.

His entire body was covered in blood. Never would the other vampires imagine that so much blood could cling to one person.

The eldest lets out a sigh, and plops to the ground. He reaches for his glasses, and cleans them with what remains of his cloak.

The younger vampires look at each other, not sure whether to break the silence.

Finally, the youngest asks, ""So...?""

""Who did they beat?""

""Leeds"" was the instant reply.

""And the score?""

""2-1.""

The Liverpudlian approached him with the greeting ""How"". 

The Memory man looked up and said, ""Diving header in the six yard box"". "

1748,Jokes,"Sharing... An elderly couple stands at the counter at the local burger joint. The man orders a deluxe burger, large fries, and a cup of decaf. The counter clerk turns to the woman and asks her what she would like. 

“Oh, nothing for me, deary. My husband and I share everything.'” 

The clerk hits a key on the register and tells the couple that the cost of the meal is $4.98. 

The old man reaches into his pockets and pulls out a handful of coins. Slowly and carefully, without a penny to spare, he counts out the exact amount and hands it to the cashier.

A young man standing behind the couple watches this. As the clerk assembles the couple’s order, he leans forward and says, “I’d be honored to buy you another burger and fries.”

The old man turns to the young man and says, “Thank you, but my wife and I share everything.” 

The old man carries the tray of food to a table and they sit. Carefully, he cuts the burger in half, divides the fries into two equal portions, and passes half of the food to the woman. He sets the decaf in the center of the table so they can both reach it. Then he begins to eat.  

A few minutes later, the young man sits down at the table next to them. As he gobbles down his food, he notices that, while the elderly man eats, the woman is quietly sipping decaf. When he looks at her food, he sees that she hasn’t eaten a single bite. Again, he leans toward the couple and says, “I really would be honored to buy you another meal.'”

The old man says, “No, thank you. We share everything,” and calmly resumes eating.

“I just hate to see you go hungry,” the young man laments to the woman.

“Oh, I’m not going hungry,” the old woman says. “I’m waiting for the teeth.”

Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1 000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero. 

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get Lost. The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the kings underwear. The king immediately summoned Nick."

One night as they were driving to yet another rubber-chicken dinner, Einstein mentioned to his chauffeur (a man who somewhat resembled Einstein in looks &amp; manner) that he was tired of speechmaking.

""I have an idea, boss,"" his chauffeur said. ""I've heard you give this speech so many times. I'll bet I could give it for you.""

Einstein laughed loudly and said, ""Why not? Let's do it!""

When they arrive at the dinner, Einstein donned the chauffeur's cap and jacket and sat in the back of the room. The chauffeur gave a beautiful rendition of Einstein's speech and even answered a few questions expertly.

Then a supremely pompous professor asked an extremely esoteric question about anti-matter formation, digressing here and there to let everyone in the audience know that he was nobody's fool.

Without missing a beat, the chauffeur fixed the professor with a steely stare and said, ""Sir, the answer to that question is so simple that I will let my chauffeur, who is sitting in the back, answer it for me.""

The room is filled with a hundred or so of the best looking people the guy's ever seen, men in tuxedos, women in fantastic gowns. He steps into the room and sees the room is lined with leather couches, and waitresses are walking around and handing out champagne. Completely taken aback, the guy decides to go sit on one of the couches, alone, and watch.

After fifteen minutes of watching, the elevator opens and a seven-foot tall goatee'd man in a red tuxedo steps out and starts glad-handing everyone. The guy notices he has small horns on his forehead and a tail out the back of the tuxedo. The red tuxedo'd man comes over and shakes the guy's hand. He says, ""Hey glad you made it! Welcome to Hell. I'm Satan. If there's *anything* I can do for you to make your stay comfortable, let me know.""

Still stunned, the guy nods and continues to sit while Satan goes off to talk to others. He notices the room is walled with tinted glass, but beyond the glass, he can make out fire, brimstone, and shadowed human figures writhing in agony.

When Satan comes back over to the newly deceased guy, he says, ""Hey, I hope you're enjoying your first day here. Is there anything I can get for you? Champagne? Cocaine?""

The guy shakes his head and says, ""Uh, no, thanks, but I was wondering... what's with all the people out in the fire? They're in agony.""

Satan ahs and nods. ""Those are the Christians. They wouldn't have it any other way."""

1533,Jokes,"A fly over a stream. [Dirty Joke] One day, in a peaceful forest, a fly buzzed over a stream.

In the stream, a salmon was swimming, and it looked up and saw the fly. It thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, I'd be able to jump up, catch it, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Alongside the stream, a bear was standing. The bear looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, and I could jump out, snag that salmon, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Across the stream, up a steep slope, a hunter was hidden in the brush. The hunter looked at the fly, and thought to himself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, and I could jump up, shoot the bear, and I'd have myself a new trophy.""

Hidden in the grass behind the hunter was a mouse. The mouse looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, the salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, the hunter would jump up to shoot the bear, the sandwich in the hunter's pocket would fall out, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

A bit higher up the slope, on a jutting rock, sat a pussy cat. The pussy cat looked down at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, the salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, the hunter would jump up to shoot the bear, the sandwich in the hunter's pocket would fall out, the mouse would hop over to get the sandwich, I could leap down on it, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

At that moment, the fly dropped down about a half an inch. The salmon leapt up and caught the fly, the bear leapt out and snagged the salmon, the hunter jumped up and shot the bear, the mouse hopped out and started to eat the hunter's sandwich, and the pussy cat leapt down to catch the mouse...but it missed. It rolled down the slope, and fell into the stream.

Moral of the Story: A lot of things have to happen to get a pussy wet.

There was a silence, and the captain finally said, ""Throw that son of a bitch overboard right now.""

Oh, when I was a kid in show business I was poor. I used to go to orgies to eat the grapes.

When I was a kid I got no respect. The time I was kidnapped, and the kidnappers sent my parents a note they said, ""We want five thousand dollars or you'll see your kid again.""

I tell ya, my wife was never nice. On our first date, I asked her if I could give her a goodnight kiss on the cheek - she bent over!

I tell you, with my doctor, I don't get no respect. I told him, ""I've swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills."" He told me to have a few drinks and get some rest. 

Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt because he leaves a pyramid in every room.

With my dog I don't get no respect. He keeps barking at the front door. He don't want to go out. He wants me to leave.

What a dog I got. His favorite bone is in my arm!

Last week I saw my psychiatrist. I told him, ""Doc, I keep thinking I'm a dog."" He told me to get off his couch.

I worked in a pet store and people kept asking how big I'd get."

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy birthday!"", and possibly have a present for me.

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy birthday"".

I thought... well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. My kids ate breakfast and didn't say a word.

So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary, Jane said, ""Good morning boss, happy birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know,it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"".

I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!

""We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""

She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".

After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back"".

""OK"", I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... followed by my wife, kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"".

1407,Jokes,"A rapist and a con artist get caught... A rapist and con artist get caught by the sheriff in a small town.  The town doesn’t have much money to take care of prisoners so the sheriff gets an idea.  He decides he’ll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can.  The sheriff figures  even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.

The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop.  He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin.  Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

After a while there are two long lines for the criminals.  Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in.  After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore.  I’m not going to waste my money on that.”  So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

The sheriff sees this and hurries over and says, “Hey son, you can’t do that here.” 

The man asks, “Why not?”

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

sons.  Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of
the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow waslying dead in the field.  The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?

In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself.  When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the
hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.

Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the
cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.  When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank.  She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair.  But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again.  So the mermaid drowned him in the river.

Next the second oldest son woke up.  After discovering what had
happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.  The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven
times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him
in the river.

The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone.  He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.  And there he also met the mermaid.  ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row."" The young son replied, ""Is that all?  Why not twenty times in a row?"" The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request.  Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""

Finally, she said, ""Enough!!  Okay, if you will have sex with me
thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect
health."" Then the young son asked, ""Wait!  How do I know that thirty
times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?"""

Try as they might, they quickly realize that avoiding the birds is going to be a difficult task. And then it happens, ""QUACK!""  Friends Two and Three look over in shock as Friend One steps on a duck. Quickly, an angel rushes over with one of the most unattractive people the three of them have ever seen. ""Because you stepped on a duck, you are condemned to spend the rest of you time in the Kingdom shackled to this person. Have a good eternity.""  The angel shackles the two together and flies off. 

After seeing what happened to Friend One, the other two are more wary of the consequences and begin treading extremely lightly. The two of them make it another three days before, on the dawn of the fourth day, a loud ""QUACK"" is heard. Friend Two looks to Friend Three, wide-eyed, fearing the worst. The angel rushes over, ties Friend Two to a hideous being, and flies away. 

The third friend, now petrified that this will be his fate, becomes incredibly paranoid, barely walking anywhere. He lasts one week, two weeks, but on the beginning of the third week an angel brings one of the most stunningly beautiful people the friend has ever seen, shackles the two of them together, and flies off. Bewildered and excited, Friend Three proclaims, ""Wow!  What did I do to deserve this?""  And the person the friend is shackled to turns and replies ""I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!"""
1284,Jokes,"why i fired my secretary Why I fired my secretary:

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say,
""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!""
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""
I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""
After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""
""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.
Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"".
And I just sat there...
On the couch...
Sobbing...
Naked...

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks.

1260,Jokes,"A bit dated, but it gave me a chuckle nonetheless. (Blatantly stolen from a grandma email.) A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in Montana when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.

Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.

He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.

Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Bud.

""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""

""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

He got his brand new Corvette convertible out of the dealership. Taking off down the road, he floored it to 80 mph, enjoying the wind blowing through what little hair he had left. ""Amazing,"" he thought as he flew down I-75, pushing the pedal even more. Looking in his rear view mirror, he saw the highway patrol behind him, blue lights 
flashing and siren blaring.

He floored it to 100mph, then 110, then 120. Suddenly he thought, ""What am I doing? I'm too old for this,"" and pulled over to await the Trooper's arrival.

Pulling in behind him, the Trooper walked up to the Corvette, looked at his watch and said, ""Sir, my shift ends in 30 minutes. 
Today is Friday.

If you can give me a reason for speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you go.""

The old gentleman paused. Then said, ""Years ago, my wife ran off with a Florida State Trooper. I thought you were bringing her back.""

""Have a good day, Sir,"" replied the Trooper

I am well. Hope you are. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to join up quick before all of the places are filled.

I was restless at first because you get to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m. But I am getting used to it, so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt and Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot, and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing.

Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there’s warm water. Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food, plus yours, holds you until noon when you get fed again. It’s no wonder these city boys can’t walk much.

We go on “route marches,” which the platoon sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it’s not my place to tell him different. A “route march” is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks.

The sergeant is like a school teacher. He nags a lot. The Captain is like the school board. Majors and colonels just ride around and frown. They don’t bother you none.

This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don’t know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don’t move, and it ain’t shooting at you like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don’t even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.

Then we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain’t like fighting with that ole bull at home. I’m about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake . I only beat him once. He joined up the same time as me, but I’m only 5’6″ and 130 pounds and he’s 6’8″ and near 300 pounds dry.

Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in.

Your loving daughter,

stole the car, had a gun in the glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.


Driver: Yeah, I'll bet the liar told you I was speeding, too.

After a complete exam the doctor told the man that the muscles around the base of his penis were damaged from a prior viral infection and there was nothing he could do for him.

So, with the assurance that there would be no cruelty or adverse effect on the elephant, the man decided to go for it.

""Hey mister! Nice pants!"" it says.

He looks around, doesn’t see anything, and quickly shrugs it off. After a little bit, he takes another sip and hears the voice again.

“Hey barkeep,” he begins, “what is that high-pitched voice I keep hearing?”

“Oh, those are the peanuts,” he replies. “They’re complimentary.”

party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued

was no need for his good time to be spoiled by her not going. So he
took his costume and away he went.

The wife, after sleeping soundly for about an hour, woke without pain,

not with him.

costume, cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice ""chick""

left his new partner high and dry and devoted his time to her.

husband. After more drinks he finally whispered a little proposition
in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had
passionate intercourse in the back seat.

put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of
explanation he would make up for his outrageous behaviour.

To do this, they set up a flower stand, and do a pretty good business selling flowers in the small village. Unfortunately, there is another floral store that is losing business because of the friars. So, they go talk to the friars, telling them to stop selling flowers, because they are losing money. The friars say ""no way man, free country, free enterprise."" 

The owners of the other floral shop decide to get real about these religious flower sellers, so they hire a hitman to go take them out. The hitman, named Hugh, shows up to the friars' store. Hugh, now, he's about 7'1', and 240 pounds of pure muscle. ""Hey,"" he says, ""you guys ought to stop sellin flowers."" The petrified friars agree that maybe the floral business isn't such a good idea after all, and promptly shut it down.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars."

971,Jokes,"No Sex Tonight. I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. I have never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.

FOR EXAMPLE: One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says “I don’t feel like it, I just want you to hold me.”

I said “WHAT??!! What was that?!”

So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear…
“You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me
to satisfy your physical needs as a man”.
She responded to my puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?”

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store.
I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits.
She couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.
Let me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.
I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey”.
She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.
Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all
dear, let’s go to the cashier”.

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel
like it”.

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled
""WHAT?”.

I then said “honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”
And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”.

Apparently I’m not having sex tonight either."

Is it A) the condor; B) the buzzard; C) the cuckoo; or D) the vulture?"" 

She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it. Mainly because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde. 

But the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: ""That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo.""

On the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded.

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt bad and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played 'Amazing Grace,' the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

The hippy is now filled with joy and decides to go through with this plan.

Later that night the hippy, wearing his newly purchased Tom Cruise mask, goes to the cemetery and sees the girl. He can't quite make out her face because she is wearing a veil, but he doesn't think much of it and assumes it is to hide her emotions when she visits her dead fathers grave.

She replies, ""Oh my god, you're my favourite actor, but unfortunately I am waiting till marriage to have sex, is it alright with you if we only do anal?""

The girl looks back at him, and removing her veil she replies, ""Haha, I'm the bus driver!"""

Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew
that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch
them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his
colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio
thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than
satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it.      

Without pause, Nick readily agreed to the scheme.

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little
bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the
itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal
Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen
that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this
type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom, 

only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their
chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he
put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on
the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was
eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and was hailed by the King and Queen
as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment
of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have
cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and
with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder
into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick . . .

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

Finally, the son said, ""Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.""

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, ""If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.

""Father,"" replied the son, ""I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, ""If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.""

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.

""Father,"" said the son to this, ""I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.""

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. ""A carton of pink ping pong balls?""

""A carton of pink ping pong balls,"" the boy confirmed.

""I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,"" said the father, ""but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have."" And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

""Dear son,"" said the father, ""I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?""

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. ""Please humour me, dear father.""

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. ""Dearest father,"" the son started, ""I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls."" One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.

""Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible."" It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.

""Father,"" the son said, ""You've made me very happy yet again."" That night, the son spent on board the tanker.

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.

His father visited the young man in hospital. ""My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?""

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. ""Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.""

The father held his son's hand tightly. ""Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.""

""Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.""

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.

""Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.""

The son nodded weakly.

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.

""Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,"" the father requested.

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.

""I-"" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

""I- I-""

Then he died."

""WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT MATE?!"" He yells.

The Englishman (being very good under pressure) replies with, ""Oh nothing old chap, but I cannot help but admire your teeth. You have a fine set of teeth, take care of them or they shall rot like mine,"" he opens his mouth and reveals a set of false teeth.

Tiny is a bit surprised by this, but in true politeness, he puts the Englishman down, brushes him off and buys him a drink.

Ten minutes later, the American cannot help but look one last time.
Tiny rumbles across the bar again, repeating the choke slam against the wall and yells,

""THE HELL DO YOU WANT BUDDY?!""

So the American (also being on the ball tonight) swiftly says,
""I can't help but admire those darn ears. Those are some mighty fine ears you got there Tiny, you best look after them or you are going to need hearing aids like mine,""
So of course the American taps his hearing aids.

Tiny, being a true gentlemen, sets him back down, brushes him off and buys him a drink.

20 minutes later, the Irishman glances in Tiny's direction.

Tiny races across the bar, and pins him against the wall by his throat, yelling;

""AND JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT?!""

So the Irishman, thinking quickly replies;

""Well, I cannot help but noticin' your eyes. You have a fine pair of eyes lad, and you best take good care of them, or you will need glasses like me and that wouldn't work because you got no nose to rest them on."""

Doctor: I'm sorry but I can't help you out.

The doctor sits and debates for a few minutes and then sighs again.

769,Jokes,"OLD AGE AND TREACHERY WILL OVERCOME YOUTH AND SKILL EVERY TIME! A father, son and grandson went to the country club for their weekly round of golf. Just as they reached the first tee, a beautiful young blond woman carrying her bag of clubs approached them.

She explained that the member who brought her to the club for a round of golf had an emergency that called him away and asked the trio whether she could join them.

Naturally, the guys all agreed.

Smiling, the blonde thanked them and said, 'Look, fellows, I work in a topless bar as a dancer, so nothing shocks me anymore. If any of you want to smoke cigars, have a beer, bet, swear, tell off-color stories or do anything that you normally do when playing a round together, go ahead. But, I enjoy playing golf, consider myself pretty good at it, so don't try to coach me on how to play my shots.'

With that the guys agreed to relax and invited her to drive first.

All eyes were fastened on her shapely behind as she bent to place her ball on the tee. She then took her driver and hit the ball 270 yards down the middle, right in front of the green.

The father's mouth was agape. 'That was beautiful,' he said.

The blonde put her driver away and said, 'I really didn't get into it, and I faded it a little.'

After the three guys hit their drives and their second shots, the blonde took out an eight iron and lofted the ball within five feet of the hole. (She was closest to the pin.)

The son said, 'Damn, lady, you played that perfectly.'

The blonde frowned and said, 'It was a little weak, but even an easy seven would have been too much club. I've left a tricky little putt.' She then tapped in the five-footer for a birdie.

Having the honors, she drove first on the second hole, knocked the heck out of the ball, and it landed nearly 300 yards away smack in the middle of the fairway.

For the rest of the round the statuesque blonde continued to amaze the guys, quietly and methodically shooting for par or less on every hole.

When they arrived at the 18th green, the blond was three under par, and had a very nasty 
12-foot putt on an undulating green for a par.

She turned to the three guys and said, 'I really want to thank you all for not acting like a bunch of chauvinists and telling me what club to use or how to play a shot, but I need this putt for a 69 and I'd really like to break 70 on this course.

If any one of you can tell me how to make par on this hole I'll take him back to my apartment, pour some 35-year-old Single Malt Strath Mill Scotch in him, fix him a steak dinner and then show him a very good time the rest of the night.'

The yuppie son jumped at the thought! He strolled across the green, carefully eyeing the line of the putt and finally said, 'Honey, aim about 6 inches to the right of the hole and hit it firm. It will get over that little hump and break right into the cup.'

The father knelt down and sighted the putt using his putter as a plumb. 'Don't listen to the kid, darlin', you want to hit it softly 10 inches to the right and let it run left down that little hogback, so it falls into the cup.'

The old gray-haired grandfather walked over to the blonde's ball, picked it up and handed it to her and said, 'That's a gimme, sweetheart.' The blonde smiled and said, 'Your car or mine?'"

750,Jokes,"Baby Confusion An English, a Pakistani, and an Irish couple all simultaneously arrive at a hospital, all of the wives in the couple going into labour at approximately the same time. All of the babies were delivered healthily after fairly routine births but unfortunately, after placing the babies in their cradles, the nurse realized that she had forgotten to place tags on the different sheets. She informed the doctor of her mistake and that she was unable to recall which baby was which. The doctor was something of a scientist and believed that there was a parenting instinct which would allow them to identify the babies. He said they would let the couples go in, look at the babies, and take whichever one they identified as their own through this inherent, natural drive.

The English couple went first, returning almost immediately carrying the darkest skinned child. The nurse, recognizing this, approached the English couple to inform them;.

""Sir, no offence, but I believe that this child belongs to that Pakistani couple over there""

""Yeah, I know mate, but I heard that the other couple over there is Irish and I'm not taking any chances"""

Dear Walter,


I hope you can help me here. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help.

When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbours daughter. I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbours daughter is 22. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past 
six months.

I told him to stop or I would leave him. He was sacked from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore.

Can you please help?

Sincerely, Sheila

-------------------------------


Dear Sheila:

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no dirt in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.

I hope this helps.


Walter."

She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because, ""It's a lot of money!"" After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her into the president's office.

The bank president then asked her how much she would like to deposit. She replied, ""$165,000!"" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, ""Madam, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?"" The old lady replied, ""I make bets."" The president then asked, ""Bets? What kind of bets?"" The old woman said, ""Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square."" The president laughs, ""That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!"" The old lady challenged, ""So, would you like to take my bet?"" The president agrees, ""Sure, I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't square!"" The little old lady then said, ""Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10am as a witness?""
""Sure!"" replied the confident president.

That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet. The next morning, at precisely 10am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office.

She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet ""$25,000 says the president's balls are square!"" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. ""Well, Okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.""

Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, ""What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?""

Opening the second door, he saw a room full of people standing on their heads on a wooden floor. Better, he thought, but best to check the last door.

Upon opening the last door, he saw a room full of people, standing waist-deep in excrement and sipping coffee.

""Of the three, this one looks best,"" he said and waded in to get something to drink while Satan closed the door.

671,Jokes,"When Engineers go to hell... An engineer dies and reports to the Pearly Gates. Saint Peter checks his dossier and, not seeing his name there, accidentally sends him to Hell.
It doesn’t take long before the engineer becomes rather dissatisfied with the level of comfort in Hell. He soon begins to design and build improvements. Shortly thereafter, Hell has air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators. Needless to say, the engineer is a pretty popular guy.
One day, God calls Satan and says with a sneer: ""So, how are things in Hell?""
Satan replies: ""Hey, things are going great. We’ve got air conditioning, flush toilets, and escalators. And there’s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.""
""What!"" God exclaims: ""You’ve got an engineer? That’s a mistake -- he should never have been sent to Hell... send him to me.""
""Not a chance,"" Satan replies: ""I like having an engineer on the staff, and I’m keeping him!""
God insists: ""Send him back or I’ll sue.""
Satan laughs uproariously and answers: ""Yeah, right. And where are you going to get a lawyer?"""

""And whose clock is that one?""
St. Peter responded, ""That's Abraham Lincoln's clock.
The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abraham told only two lies in his entire life.""
""Where's Donald Trump's clock?"" asked the man.

670,OtherJokes,"Two men contracted to paint a small community church. Being very frugal(cheap), they pinched and scraped to spend the absolute minimum on materials. Then, when they were only partway through the job, they determined that they did not, after all, have enough paint to complete the job. Not wishing to spend any more money if they didn't absolutely have to, they decided they would just dilute the water-based paint they were using so that it would last longer. They did this a couple more times before they finished, which caused striping on the church as the paint got lighter eachtime it was thinned. The painters had just about gotten to the top of thesteeple, when, all of a sudden, the sky darkened, and the rain started to pour down. 

As the paint streamed down the sides of the church, a voice boomed from the heavens: ""Repaint, you thinners! Repaint, and thin no more!"""

“Let’s ask them.” replied the Senator. The senior advisors were called to the Senator’s office.

Jones explained the basics of the GI Insurance to the new recruits, and then said: ""If you have GI Insurance and go into battle and are killed, the government has to pay $200,000 to your beneficiaries.


If you don't have GI insurance, and you go into battle and get killed, the government only has to pay a maximum of $6000.""

It was the mailman's last day on the job after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood. When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.


At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.


""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, ""but what's the dollar for?"" ""Well,"" she said, ""last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you."" He said, ""Screw him, give him a dollar."" The lady then said, ""The breakfast was my idea.""

A lady goes to her parish priest one day and tells him, ""Father, I have a problem. I have two female parrots but they only know how to say one thing.""


""What do they say?"" the priest inquired.


""They say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?'"" the woman said embarrassingly.


""That's obscene!"" the priest exclaimed, ""I can see why you are embarrassed.""


He thought a minute and then said, ""You know, I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop saying that...that phrase in no time.""


""Thank you,"" the lady responded, ""this may very well be the solution.""


The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.


After just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out in unison, ""Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?""


There was a stunned silence. Finally, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and said, ""Put the beads away, Francis, our prayers have been answered!""

One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.


He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. ""Goodness,"" says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.


Upon awaking, the little guy says, ""Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.""


The man says, ""I can't take anything from you, I""m just glad I didn""t hurt you too badly,"" and walks away.


Watching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, ""Well, he was a nice enough guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I'll give him the three things that I would want. I'll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.""


Well, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.


The leprechaun says, ""I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?""


The golfer says, ""It's great! I hit under par every time.""


The leprechaun says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?""


The golfer says, ""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.""


The leprechaun smiles and says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?""


The golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, ""Well, maybe once or twice a week.""


The leprechaun is floored and stammers, ""Once or twice a week?!""


The golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, ""Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.""

The teacher promptly takes him to the principal's office and explains the story to the principal.


The principal tells Johnny about his own trip to school that day. He says, ""I was walking to school through the park on the trail today when I heard something behind me. I turned around and was shocked to see a giant grizzly bear behind me. He was 24 feet tall and had 6-inch fangs. He was going to eat me, Johnny!

What do you think of that, Johnny?""


Johnny replies, ""Oh yeah, that's my dog Sparky. That's his third bear this week.""

A defendant was on trial for murder in Philadelphia. There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense’s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick.


""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,"" the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. ""Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom.""
He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened.


Finally the lawyer said, ""Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.""


The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.


""But how?"" inquired the lawyer. ""You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.""
Answered the jury foreman: ""Oh, we did look. But your client didn’t.""

I knew just what

She wanted to do

Her skin so soft

Her legs so fine

I ran my fingers

Down her spine

I didn't know how

But I tried my best

I started by placing

My hands on her breast

I remember my fear

My fast beating heart

But slowly she spread

Her legs apart

And when I did it

I felt no shame

All at once

The white stuff came

At last it's finished

It's all over now

My first time ever

At milking a cow...

A couple who drove their car to K-Mart only to have their car breakdown in the parking lot. The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car.


The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones.


Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward and tucked everything back into place.
On regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by.


The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.

A golfer stands over his tee shot for what seems an eternity to his partner. He looks up, looks down, measures the distance and figures the wind direction and speed. The longer he takes, the more his partner fidgets. Finally his exasperated partner says, ""What's taking so long? Hit the blasted ball.""
The guy answers, ""My wife is up there watching me from the clubhouse. I want to make this a perfect shot.""


""Forget it, man,"" the partner says. ""You'll never hit her from here.""

The Mafia was looking for a new man to make weekly collections from all the private businesses that they were ""protecting."" Feeling the heat from the police force, they decide to use a deaf and dumb person for this job. If he were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police what he was doing.


On his first week, the collector picks up over $40,000. He gets greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place. The Mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.


The hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. The deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the Mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.


The Mafia hood says to the interpreter, ""Ask him where da money is.""


The interpreter signs, ""Where's the money?""


The dumb man signs back, ""I don't know what you're talking about.""


The interpreter tells the hood, ""He says he doesn't know what you're talking about.""


The hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the dumb collector. ""Now ask him where the money is!""


The interpreter signs, ""Where is the money?


The deaf man signs back, ""The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park.""


The interpreter says to the hood, ""He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger.""

653,Jokes,"Anger Management I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. 

I found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered, saying 'Hello.' 

I politely said, 
'This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' 

Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear 
'Get the right f***ing number!' 
And the phone was slammed down on me. 

I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. 

When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, 
I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. 

After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. 

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, 
And put it in my desk drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, 
I'd call him up and yell, 'You're an asshole!' 

It always cheered me up. 

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. 

So, I called his number and said, 'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. 
I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' 

He yelled 'NO!' And slammed down the phone. 

I quickly called him back and said, 'That's because you're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. 

Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. 

I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. 

I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number. 

A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (I had his number on speed dial) 
I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too. 

I said, 'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?' 

He said, 'Yes, it is.' 

I then asked, 'Can you tell me where I can see it?' 

He said, 'Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd. , in Fairfax 
It's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' 

I asked, 'What's your name?' 

He said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

I asked, 'When's a good time to catch you, Don?' 

He said, 'I'm home every evening after five.' 

I said, 'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?' 

He said, 'Yes?' 

I said, 'Don, you're an asshole!' 

Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. 

Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. 

Then I came up with an idea... 

I called asshole #1. 

He said, 'Hello' 

I said, 'You're an asshole!' 
(But I didn't hang up.) 

He asked, 'Are you still there?' 

I said, 'Yeah!' 

He screamed, 'Stop calling me' 

I said, 'Make me.' 

He asked, 'Who are you?' 

I said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

He said, 'Yeah? Where do you live?' 

I said, 'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, a yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.' 

He said, 'I'm coming over right now, Don. 
And you had better start saying your prayers.' 

I said, 'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' and hung up. 

Then I called Asshole #2. 

He said, 'Hello?' 

I said, 'Hello, asshole,' 

He yelled, 'If I ever find out who you are...' 

I said, 'You'll what?' 

He exclaimed, 'I'll kick your ass' 

I answered, 'Well, asshole, here's your chance. 
I'm coming over right now.' 

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover. 

Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax .
I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax . 

I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew. 

NOW I feel much better.

""Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you."" 

The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff, and says, ""Hey I didn't know that Mary worked here..."""

601,OtherJokes,"How many lawyers does it take to change a lightbulb? Such number as may be deemed necessary to perform the stated task in a timely and efficient manner within the strictures of the following agreement. Whereas the party of the first part, who will be henceforth be addressed as 'the lawyers' and the party of the second part, henceforth addressed as 'the light bulb' do hereby agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e. the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (North) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just through the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (light bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.


The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:


The party of the first part (lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (light bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (light bulb) in a counter clockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (light bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) to perform the customary and agreed upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part (lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (lawyer) throughout.


Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (light bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part ('receptacle'), the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (light bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.


Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (lawyer) shall have the option of beginning the installation of the party of the fourth part ('new light bulb'). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse procedures described in step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable and only until the party of the fourth part (new light bulb) becomes snug in the party of the third part (receptacle) and in fact actually becomes the party of the second part (light bulb).


NB: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (lawyer), by said party of the first part (lawyer), or by his or her heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him or her to do so with the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (North) door consistent with maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as 'The Firm'.

The salesman stepped forward to give his prepared demo. ""This,"" he said, ""is the Ultimate Computer. It will give an intelligent answer to any question you may care to ask it. Would anyone like to try?""
Little Johnny quickly stepped forward and asked, ""Where is my father?""
There was the soft hum of powerful electronic gear going to the task. Panel lights lit and blinked, and within a couple of seconds the answer appeared on the screen: ""Fishing in Florida.""
Little Johnny laughed, ""Actually, my father is dead! It was a trick question.""
The salesman, quickly thinking on his feet, replied that he was sorry the answer was unsatisfactory, but as the Ultimate Computer was precise, perhaps a rewording of the question might work better.
Little Johnny thought and said to the Ultimate Computer, ""Where is my mother's husband?"" Again, the hum of the powerful electronic brain filled the room.
After a moment, the screen lit up with an answer: ""Dead. But your father is still fishing in Florida."""
542,OtherJokes,"[Long]A squad of soldiers-in-training stood in line to get their practice weapons... ...for an upcoming simulated battle. As the last guy got up to the sergeant, the sergeant said, “sorry son, we’re all out. Take this broom instead.” The private looked puzzled so the sergeant explained, “When you see the enemy, point the broom at them and say ‘bangity, bangity, bang.’ Don’t worry, it will work fine.”

So the private and the rest of his squad headed out to the battle field. Shortly after they started marching, the private spotted an enemy. Reluctantly, he put the broom up to his shoulder, aimed down the handle and shouted, “bangity, bangity, bang.” Much to his surprise, the enemy fell over. A few moments later, he spotted another enemy, pointed his broom, and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang.” Again, the enemy fell over. 

This, of course energized the private so he jumped up, pointed his broom and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang,” “bangity, bangity, bang,” ‘bangity, bangity, bang.’ Enemies fell all around him. 

Off in the distance, he spotted another enemy, raised his broom and shouted “bangity, bangity, bang.” This time, however, the enemy didn’t fall over. As the enemy got closer, the private pointed his broom and shouted even louder, “bangity, bangity, bang.” Still, the enemy didn’t fall and, instead, just kept marching toward the private. 

The enemy got within feet of the private and one more time he aimed his broom and screamed, “bangity, bangity, bang.” But the enemy just kept on marching. He walked into the private, knocked him over, stepped on him and kept on walking. And as he went by, the private heard the enemy say, “tankity, tankity, tank, tankity, tankity, tank.”

The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...

But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."

Right now we can only admit people who have died in horrible fashions, and those who have died in a more mundane way will have to wait in limbo, and it could take a decade or two to work you in.""

So St. Peter takes aside the first man, and asks him how he died. ""Well, I'd been suspicious of my wife having an affair for some time now, so today I came home from work early. I just knew the guy was in my apartment, but I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere and was just about to give up, when I went out on the balcony of my 23rd story apartment and there he was hanging over the edge! He was just barely hanging on, there was no way he could climb back onto the balcony. It was a really stupid place to try to hide. I was livid, so I started punching him and clawing at his fingers, but he held on. Finally I went to get a hammer and started pounding on his fingers, and he fell down. But what really angered me was that he landed in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! I was so mad I grabbed the refrigerator, threw it off the balcony and it landed on him. Unfortunately I was so riled up by the incident I had a heart attack and died.""

St. Peter was taken aback, and said ""While you did die in a dramatic fashion, I think we need to look at that whole second degree murder before we let you in - off to limbo with you."" He then approached the second man and asked him how he had died.

""I was riding my exercise bike on the balcony of my 24th story apartment, when the thing broke and threw me over the railing!

I thought I was going to fall but then someone came out on the balcony. I thought he would help me, until he started hitting me! I held on as best I could, but when he got a hammer and started hitting me I finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell. Somehow, though, I fell in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! Just as I'm coming around, I look up and BAM this refrigerator lands on me. So here I am.""

423,OtherJokes,"There was a guy who was having chronic trouble getting an erection. After weeks of frustration, he finally decides he is going to go see a doctor. The doctor gives him a thorough examination and eventually makes the diagnosis. 

""Well, there's good news and there's bad news,"" she says.

""The bad news is that the muscles around your penis are deteriorating, and there is no cure.""

The guy, on the verge of panic, finally regains his composure. ""So what's the good news?"" he asks.

The doctor says, ""There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a  baby elephant's trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?""

The guy thinks about it and finally says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it."" So the doctor performs the operation.

A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend out to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment. While sitting at the table, he feels a stirring between his legs; it gets progressively worse until it reaches a point of being painful.

Seeking relief, he reaches down and unzips his fly to relieve some of the pressure.  

Suddenly, his penis leaps free from his pants, slides over the tabletop and grabs a dinner roll, then returns to his pants again.

""Wow!"" says his girlfriend stunned, ""That was impressive! Can you do it again?""

Eyes watering and face flushed, he says, ""Probably... but I don't know if I can fit another dinner roll up my ass!"""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a beautiful sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. 

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

One hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. 

By 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. 

By noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. 

At 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. 

By 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. 

2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces ""JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!"" 

Satan is furious. ""How can this be?"" He asks. ""I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!""

Jesus taunts Satan. ""Well I don't see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off.""

""Your computer was shut off, too!"" Satan retorts. ""I guess neither of us win!"" 

God, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan's coding cannot be found, but when Jesus's computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. 

""How can this be?"" Satan snarls. ""I finished more coding! It should be there! I should've won this!"" 

""Satan, my friend,"" God says, ""You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... 

Jesus saves.""

""Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private part is covered only by a fig leaf. ""

When we did your blood work, your blood sugar level was at 500 which effectively makes you a brand of coffee sweetener. I couldn't even take your blood pressure with a normal pressure cuff because of how fat your arms are. I had to jerry-rig a cuff out of the spare tire of my Ford F150.

309,OtherJokes,"It was the best KISS hed ever had. A group of HELLS ANGELS, South Carolina bikers were riding east on 378 when they saw a girl about to jump off the Pee Dee River Bridge. So they stopped.
 
George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says,
""Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""
 
She says tearfully, ""I'm going to commit suicide!!""
 
While he didn't want to appear ""sensitive,"" George also didn't want to miss this ""be-a-legend"" opportunity either so he asked . . . ""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . .
why don't you give ol' George here your best last kiss?""
 
So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . .
and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.
 
After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?""

She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce.

The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan.

The loan officer says, ""Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found out that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""

308,AntiJokes,"Man and a Clown (long but worth it) As a child Sam was as happy as could be; playing with sticks, climbing trees, all that good shit. One day for his sixth birthday his parents decided to take him to the circus. Little Sam was so excited he could not stop bouncing in his seat in the car, nor could he stand still in line whilst his parents purchased their tickets.


Sam and his parents find their seats and wait for the circus to commence(the waiting nearly killed Sam). Finally the circus starts; the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, and finally towards the end of the show the clowns come out. This is what Sam has been waiting for all night (he loves to laugh).


The clowns go through their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, etc.. All of the clowns but one leave the center ring. This clown turns on a microphone he is given by the ring master and says, ""Ladies and Gentleman! For your last laugh of the evening I will need a volunteer!"" Little Sam, not knowing what this was all about, was the only one who did not raise his hand.


The Clown makes a spectacle of choosing his volunteer, and finally the spot light lands on little Sam. He looks to his parents questioningly and they wave him down. After he makes his way down the aisle and into the center ring.


The clown asks, ""What is your name little boy?""

""S-sam."" he replies.

""Well S-sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?""

""N-no?""

""Well little Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?""

""No.""

""Well you must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!""


The crowd goes wild with laughter, rofl barely covers it. All the while this is happening little Sam is mortified to be laughed at by so many people and starts crying right there in the center ring which, much to his dismay, made everyone laugh all the harder. He makes his way back to his parents and they take him home all the way attempting to make him feel better.


---~10 Years Later---


Little Sam is no longer so little, he is now a Sophmore in high-school. Albeit a little awkward, tonight he is taking out a girl for their very first date. Now this girl not only is completely out of his league, but she is a very popular girl. He has done his research and found out that she is dying to go see the circus.


On their way to the circus he is so excited he is almost bouncing in his seat, of course he doesn't because that would be completely uncool of him. As they are standing in line to get their tickets, he can hardly stand still, he is definitely hoping to get some hand holding action tonight!


They take their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills not so little Sam as he inches his hand ever closer to hers without making it obvious). Finally he touches his pinky finger to her pinky just as the lights go down and the circus starts, which also happens to be when everyone begins to applaud.
He cannot truly enjoy circus because the entire time he is still trying to touch her hand. He can tell by her reactions the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget being shot out of a cannon was exhilarating. Finally the clowns come out.


This is when Sam finally begins to pay attention, he is searching for a clown he has seen 10 years ago that scarred him.


*NO SHIT!* - he thinks to himself - *THAT CAN'T BE THE SAME CLOWN!* (It was)


The clowns do their usual routine, pies to the face, falling down on purpose, hitting other clowns over the head. Towards the end of the act all of the clown leave the center ring except one. *The same fucking clown, god damn-it!*


The clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master


""Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy for the evening I will need a volunteer!""


*Like hell I'm going to volunteer* Sam thinks to himself, yet in doing this he is the only person not raising his hand. The clown again makes a spectacle of choosing volunteer. Finally the spotlight stops on not so little Sam.


Wide-eyed Sam looks over to his date and she has a brilliant smile on her face and urges him to go down after a quick kiss on the cheek. After this moment Sam is in a daze *my first kiss, oh my god, it was amazing*. The next thing he knows he is standing before the clown in the center ring.


""What is your name young man?""

*I hope its not the same lame ass joke* ""My name is Sam.""

""Well Sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?""

*Really? Again?* Reluctantly Sam says, ""No.""

""Well Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?""

""Ugh No.""

""Well then Sam, you must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!""


The crowd completely goes wild, rotflmfao barely covers it. He looks into the seats where he and his date were sitting and she is laughing just as hard as everyone else. For some reason that Sam cannot explain to this very day he broke down crying, this time in front of everyone and his date, which makes the crowd laugh even harder.
This day Sam swears his revenge on this god-awful clown.

Big Sam is now 26 years old with a family of his own; a wife of 5 years, two beautiful children, a dog, all that good shit.


For vacation Sam decides to take his family on a cruise ship. Big Sam is bouncing in his seat (he doesn't have to be cool anymore), his children are as well. As they wait to board the ship Sam can hardly stand still *Open Bar! Free Child Care! Free Massage!*. As he is handed a list of events from the person overseeing the boarding he notices there is even a circus on this cruise. *No way, what would the odds be?*


They enjoy their cruise, and on the last night Sam brings his family to the circus. They get their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills his children). The lights finally go down and it begins. The trapeze were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget getting shot out of a cannon was riveting, the motorcycles that go around in a sphere nearly took their breath away, finally the clowns come out.


*Ok you mother fucking clown where are you at? Where, oh where can you--AHA!* Sam spots the clown that has caused him so much pain in the past which is great for him because he has come up with the perfect response to this clown.


The clowns do their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, hitting others over the head with hammers, spraying others with water jet flowers. Towards the end of the act all of the clowns except one leave the center ring.


*Show time!*


The clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master.


""Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy tonight I will need a volunteer!""

*If I don't raise my hand you're going to pick me. I know your game clown!*

As usual big Sam is the only one that does not raise his hand. The clown makes a big spectacle of choosing his volunteer. Finally the spotlight lands on big Sam.


*Now its my turn!*


Before he knows it Sam is down in front of the clown with a smug smile on his face.


""Well sir, what would your name be?""

""My name would be Sam"", he replies with a confidence that makes the clown a little uneasy.

""Well Sam, are you the front-end of a jack-ass?""

""No, not I am not the front-end of a jack-ass."", he answers as smugly as he can manage. He is now bubbling with anticipation.

""Yes, well then, are you the back-end of a jack-ass?""

""Ha no, no I am not.""

""Well Sam, You must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!""


The crowd goes wild, little old ladies have heart attacks, ICU hardly covers it.
Sam grabs the microphone from the clown, and the crowd immediately quiets down.
Sam looks the clown straight in the face and says, ""Fuck you."""

308,OtherJokes,"Smart Diagnosis Machine One day, in line at the company cafeteria, Jack says to Mike behind him, ""My elbow hurts like hell. I guess I better see a doctor."" 

""Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money,"" Mike replies. ""There's a diagnostic computer at the drugstore at the corner. Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor."" 

So Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. 

Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. 

That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. 

Jack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. 

The computer prints the following:
 
1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. 
2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 
3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. 
4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 
5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better.

In the defense’s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick. 

""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,"" the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. ""Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom."" 

He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened. 

Finally the lawyer said, ""Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty."" 

The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty. 

""But how?"" inquired the lawyer. ""You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.

“Mayday, mayday! The pilot had an instant and fatal heart attack. I grabbed his cell phone out of his pocket and he had told me before we took off he had the tower on his speed dial memory. I am flying upside down at 18,000 feet and traveling at 180 mph. Mayday, mayday!”

The employee in the tower immediately put him on speaker phone. “Calm down, we acknowledge you and we’ll guide you down after a few questions. The first thing is not to panic. Remain calm!”

He began his series of questions:

Tower: “How do you know you are traveling at 18,000 feet??”

Aircraft: “I can see that it reads 18,000 feet on the altimeter dial in front of me.”

Tower: “Okay, that’s good, remain calm. How do you know you’re traveling at 180 mph?”

Aircraft: “I can see that it reads 180 mph on the airspeed dial in front of me.”

Tower: ""Okay, this is great so far, but it’s heavily overcast. So how do you know you’re flying upside down?""

273,AntiJokes,"What did the pastor say to the rabbi? ""GET DOWN!"" and then pulled the rabbi down to the ground, so as to avoid bullet fire. Yes, things were tough during those times, when the people of that ravaged city had to band together to defend themselves and their neighbors. Years later, the priest and the rabbi would invite one another to family dinners, and over ample glasses of wine, as their children played in front of the fire, they would discuss the political events that led up to such vicious tragedies, thankful that they were able to survive and prosper.

Of course, as time takes its toll, the pastor eventually passed away and the rabbi, very old, but still loving of his comrade, spoke at his funeral. It was a strange experience to see all the people gathered around him, whom the pastor had known, whom the rabbi now knew as well. He felt satisfied to be an old man with such a meaningful, long friendship that had opened up his family and included so many more, whom he may have never met if it weren't for that pastor.

Eventually ,the rabbi passed away, and his funeral was equally as attended, and both men's good will and spirit was passed down through the generations of their family. In reality, that conflict was just a blip in the course of human history; a long forgotten moment in time where tragedy, just for a second, reared its ugly head and grabbed hold of the human spirit. But the rabbi and the pastor's friendship was a testament to humanity's ability to find connections even in the worst of times. On Mars, eventually, the pastor's descendants would erect a statue of the two men, for their courage represented the tolerance and kindness of the new generation that had come forth after such a brutal conflict.

With the advent of the EM drive, humanity prospered and spread among the stars, with the rabbi and pastor's progeny being counted among the many brave explorers who discovered thousands of new worlds. Many of their children's children did not believe the same things as their forefathers, and in fact some did not believe at all, but they were still valued members of their community, and their family names lived on as respected icons of accomplishment."

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would you like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

he jumped.

Slowly at first,

but speeding up,

faster, and faster,

speeding past Pluto,

and the other outer planets,

through the asteroid belt,

past Mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

I'm a just poor tramp...

so you must understand...

I've been through many a hard ship in my life.""

Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""

Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office.

While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.

Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""
Harry: ""9.""

Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""

Harry: ""36.""

And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.

The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade""

Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""

Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""

Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""

Harry replied: ""Pockets.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""

Harry: ""Pants.""

Ms. Brooks: What starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?""

Harry: ""Coconut.""

The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.

Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""

The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""

Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""

Harry: ""Shake hands.""

The principal was trembling.

Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""

Harry: ""Firetruck.""

The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, ""Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven questions wrong."

Saint Peter leads the guy into Heaven and into a long, white corridor. Along the corridor are heavy wooden doors, all shut.

238,OtherJokes,"How my Husband and I Terrified a Taxi Driver My husband and I were dressed and ready to go out for a lovely evening of dinner and theatre.
Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.
Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.
""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""

236,OtherJokes,"How Grandpa made $25,000 in one afternoon... The IRS decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the IRS office. The IRS auditor was not surprised when Grandpa showed up with his attorney.

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.

‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’

233,OtherJokes,"John owned the local florist shop. The shop had been in his family for five generations -- and he loved his work. He was a part of people’s lives, from their first prom, to valentines gifts, birthdays, weddings, and even funerals -- he loved his work, and the town loved him. Life for him, his wife Susan, his mom Louis, and their three kids John Jr (JJ), Alexis, and Peter was perfect.

All that changed though when one day, right across the street, a new shop opened: Holy Brothers Holy Flowers. Intrigued, he went over to introduce himself. Turns out two Friars had recently left their order to open a flower store. They were elderly gentleman who had spent decades tending the garden at their Friary, but ultimately wanted to go live in the outside world. John was friendly, and thought to himself “well, I’m sure this town can support two florists,” so we went back to his store and thought nothing more of it. 

But as time went on more and more people started going to Holy Flowers. A rumor had gotten started that the flowers were blessed, and that you’d get good luck by going there. Sales dropped for John, money got tight, and he started to accrue debt. Finally, nobody came into his store at all any more.

One day, out of desperation, he went across the street to talk to the friars. He said “guys, I need you to move your store. My family has owned this place for five generations and I’m going to lose it.” The friars told him to fuck off.

He went home and told his wife. Thinking a womans touch might help, she went to talk to the friars. “My family is going to lose our home, please move to the next town over.” She was again told to fuck off.

In a moment of despair, they sent their children to go plead their case. JJ, Alexis, and Peter went to see the Friars. “Please sirs, or parents are losing everything, you have to help us out.” They too were told to fuck off.

Next, John’s mother Louis, a kindly, persuasive, but tough woman went to talk to them. She was told to fuck off.

Sitting in his dusty empty store John contemplated his failings while he killed a bottle of cheap whiskey. His store, his future, he’s lost all of it. Sitting in a stupor, a thought drifted into his mind. He remembered an old family – acquaintance. He picked up the phone and called the man, a huge (probably former felon) guy named Hugh. Nobody knew exactly what Hugh did, but he wasn’t a good guy. John’s dad had done Hugh a favor once so they were in his good graces, but this was a man to be respected and feared. 

John explained the situation to Hugh over the phone, who simply said “I’ll deal with it” and hung up the phone. 

Two days later Holy Flowers closed. No explanation, no closing sale, the just shut their doors, drove out of town as fast as they could, leaving everything behind. Customers started coming back to John, and he lived happily ever after.

The moral of the story? Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars."

Finally, after allowing this for a sufficient length of time, the therapist got up, walked around the desk and after asking the wife to stand, he embraced and kissed her long and passionately as her husband watched with a raised eyebrow.

The woman shut up and quietly sat down as though in a daze. The therapist turned to the husband and said, 'this is what your wife needs at least 3 times a week. Can you see to it?'

The biker pulled over and said, ""Build a bridge to Hawaii so I can ride over anytime I want.""
 
God replied, ""Your request is materialistic; think of the enormous challenges for that kind of undertaking; the supports required reaching the bottom of the Pacific and the concrete and steel it would take!

220,OtherJokes,"Nate the Snake joke Warning, unhealthily long Tim was an adventurous man, and he had quite a bit of money. One afternoon during work, Tim decided that he wanted to go driving on the dunes in egypt. So that weekend, he booked tickets to Cairo and took a few extra days off work. When he arrived in Cairo he took a bus to a smaller village with less people and laxer laws and rented a car to drive on the dunes. He went out the first time at night around 11:30 because his flight came in late. 

Tim had a marvelous time on the dunes: driving up and down them, going far too fast, and of course, drifting. He was at it all night and was having fun but the sky was getting brighter and he decided it was time to head home. As he started off towards the village the car suddenly sputtered and died and try as he might, Tim could not start it up again. Tim kept trying to start the car, he had extra gas so it wasn't that, what could it be? 

Eventually Tim figured out the battery had died. This worried Tim slightly but he remembered the village was to the east so he figured he could walk. The car compass said the nose was pointing east so he took his water bottle from the car and started walking off in that direction. What Tim didn't know was that the compass wasn't accurate because the car had died so he ended up walking west instead of east. He walked for a few hours at which point he climbed to the top of a large dune to see if he could see the village. From the summit he looked and could only see the car several miles back where he came from and then nothing but desert for miles and miles around.

Tim decided it would be best to head back to the car and around mid day he made it back. He then decided it would be best to follow the car tracks. He followed and followed them along but ended up back at the car. Confused and frustrated, he thought how that could happen. He concluded that because he was doing donuts, he ended up following the wrong trail. He set out again determined to find the right one; an hour later he was back at the car. He tried one last time but the wind was covering the tire tracks with sand making traveling not possible and he was forced to return to the vehicle. Tim by this point was desperate. He decided his only option was to just pick a direction and hope for the best. He collected what little remained of his water and a bottle of wiper fluid he had in his car in case he needed fluids and picked a direction and started walking.

By the time Tim left the car it was pushing 6 o'clock. He walked and walked for several hours and ended up at the foot of a large sand dune. Tim decided that his best chance of survival was to climb the dune so he set out. About 45 feet up he was feeling the burn and pretty soon it became too steep to climb. Tim got on his hands and knees determined to climb the dune. About half way up he chugged the last of his water and continued to forge on. About 3/4ths of the way up he felt like he was dying of dehydration and decided that having some fluids in him was better than none and he could be cured of the poison back in the town, so Tim drank the wiper fluid. The fluids in him again had him feeling rejuvenated and he pushed to the top of the dune.

When he reached the top his head was spinning from the wiper fluid but he had made it! He crested the peak and looked out into the falling sun expecting to see the village. Unfortunately all he saw around him was desert. Disheartened he looked to going back down the dune when he noticed something, a smallish wooden and straw structure half buried in the sand. He started crawling down the dune toward the structure, now fully feeling the effects of the poison. He crawled into an opening in the structure and by this time he was barely conscious. Inside the structure was a golden colored lever. This confused Tim, and when he stood up to try and push it, his head started spinning something bad and he collapsed into unconsciousness. 

Tim woke up to light coming through the cracks in the building and felt rejuvenated. He felt healthy. ""How is this possible?"" Tim thought to himself, ""am I dead?"" Tim started to sit up, those questions floating through his head when all of a sudden he was face to face with a snake. And much to Tim's astonishment, the snake began to speak. ""Hello I am nate the snake"" The snake said. Tim was confused and scared but he worked up the nerve to sputter out a few ""whats"" and ""hows."" The snake interrupted Tim's unintelligible babbling to say ""Travelers usually don't find this place, and the ones that do get 2 wishes. I saw that you were poisoned, dehydrated, and dying so I granted a wish on your behalf allowing you to survive and stay healthy without a need for food and water."" This made about as much sense as any explanation that Tim thought of so he accepted it. The next question that came to Tim's mind concerned the lever. Nate the Snake began to explain: 
""The lever is a doomsday lever, in fact, this area used to be what you know as the garden of eden. This lever was supposed to destroy the world and all its inhabitants if the animals became corrupt or evil, since then humanity has spread all across the planet and we can't have the world ending now can we?"" 

Tim didn't quite buy it but the snake continued his story: ""I am descendant of a generation of serpents supposed to guard this lever and make sure no travelers, such as yourself, wander across this lever and push it killing everybody."" 
By this point Tim was so confident he was hallucinating that he just went along with it. The snake asked if Tim had any questions: 
""Ya so do you know where the village is?"" Tim asked. Nate the Snake replied with a short ""no"" and continued to talk on about how Tim is the first person he'd seen in many many years, as it became more apparent that Tim didn't really care, Nate the Snake pointed out that Tim still had one wish. ""Oh right!"" Tim exclaimed and proceeded to ask Nate for an internal compass so that Tim would always know where he wanted to go. Suddenly, Tim knew the way to the village, it was about a days walk southeast of where the structure was. With that in mind, Tim thanked Nate and promised to visit again (still thinking he's hallucinating but at least he has a direction to go now) and he set out southeast to where he hoped the town was.

Tim stumbled into town later in the day convinced that he was just lucky and that the Nate the Snake encounter was a fever dream on account of the poison. He checked into a hospital and was given drugs to flush out the toxins but he was fine. He decided to cut his trip short on account of his odd adventure in the desert and he took a bus back to Cairo the next day then flew home. Tim continued his life where he left off, and he told all his friends about his ordeal in the desert, and he went on with his normal life for about 5 years.

Then one day Tim was going to go out to eat with is friends and something occurred to him: he hadn't eaten or drank anything in over a week, he'd just been too busy and didn't think of it. This puzzled Tim as he racked his brain to figure out why then suddenly the whole Nate the Snake encounter came flooding back to him. If he didn't need to eat or drink, that means the whole encounter much had actually happened! Tim became terrified then excited as he considered the possibilities of it then he remembered the promise he made to Nate to come back and visit him. He hastily bought a ticket to Cairo for the weekend and took a couple days off work. The flight was uneventful and he ended up in Cairo where he took a bus to the small village.

Tim didn't have the money to rent a car this time but since he didn't need to eat or drink he figured  he could just walk to Nate's domain. With his internal map pointing the way, Tim set off into the desert to the Northwest and walked for the rest of the afternoon and well into the night. By the time the sun was rising behind him, Tim walked over the final dune and saw the small wood and grass structure that housed the lever. When Tim was approaching the structure, Nate the Snake slithered out in front of him. ""Tim!"" Nate the Snake exclaimed, ""I thought you'd forgot about me"" 
Tim felt blood rushing into his cheeks as he felt ashamed about forgetting, ""Im sorry Nate, Ive just been so busy living my life and honestly, i chocked our whole meeting up to hallucinations due to the poison""
""Thats understandable"" nate said ""Thank you for coming back though it really means a lot to me, anyway I have someone to introduce you to.""
As if on cue, a smaller snake slithered out.
""Tim"" Nate continued, ""This is my son Joe""
""Oh hi there"" Tim said
""Now tim,"" Nate said, ""I actually have a huge favor to ask you, my son, Joe, will take over my job when I die and be bound to guard the lever forever. I want you to take Joe with you and show him the world, I know this is a lot to ask but please, I want him to see the world before he's bound to the lever forever""

Tim was hesitant but he figured that Nate had saved his life, so he owed him that favor. So after the meeting, Tim and Joe trekked back across the desert to the village and back to Cairo. Nate quit his job and they spent the remainder of his money traveling the world. Tim and Joe travelled Asia first, then the americas and finally they went to europe. It was around the 5th month of the traveling and Tim and Joe ended up in a bar in Norway. Over some beers they were discussing their plans next and Joe spoke up saying that they had been gone for a while and that it might be time to go back.  Tim agreed that it was time and they flew out to Cairo a few days later.

They landed in Cairo and took the bus to the village and started walking the day and a half journey to Nate and Joe's home. After about 6 hours of walking, Tim and Joe came across a car half buried in the sand. Tim brushed off the sand and unburied it from the sand before climbing inside. After checking out the car and briefly looking at the engine, Tim concluded that it was in working order. Tim and Joe searched a little bit for a person to whom the car belonged but found nobody around, so they hot-wired the car and started driving to shave off many hours from their journey. 

After a few hours of driving they were nearing the lever and started the last downhill section toward the lever. The car started picking up speed so Tim applied the break, and nothing happened. Tim started panicking and slamming the break but the car didn't slow down at all. ""Whats wrong?"" Joe asked with a tone of fear in his voice.
""The car's breaks or jammed it isn't working""
Tim and Joe both pushed on the breaks as hard as they could but nothing happened. They turned off the engine in desperation but the car kept sliding toward the structure, suddenly, Nate came out of the structure to the left facing away from the car but he couldn't hear because the engine was off. There was a flat area behind the structure so Tim figured if he just turned right he could roll to a stop.

Tim turned the wheel right but the car didn't shift at all because the tires were stuck in a groove. Tim kept trying to turn it but nothing was happening, he briefly by accident shifted the wheel left and the car moved. The car was going quickly toward the lever building and they had to make a move. Tim kept yelling ""What do I do?"" to Joe, he could either hit the building or move left and hit Nate because the car wouldn’t go right. Joe was rather quiet and then he looked Tim with tears in his and rested his tail upon the wheel and started pushing it to the left. Tim looked confused and scared as joe maneuvered the car so that it would hit Nate. Tim looked at Joe and asked, ""Why?"" and Joe looked back, crying now, and said:

Better Nate than lever."

His name was Robert Gooding, and he must’ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, “Hey Mike! You’ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!” I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother’s grandfather’s nephew’s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he’d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn’t always bad.

Good old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don’t think he liked it much. He didn’t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn’t start running after five minutes. I’m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family’s latest adventures.

There was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. “You know Michael,” he started as I prepared my apology, “I really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don’t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.” I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.

Our year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert’s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.

Work was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn’t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.

From the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.

However, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance. Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy’s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, “Mikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don’t do anything stupid.”

The standoff lasted for hours. If it weren’t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn’t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy’s voice at one point yelling orders like, “Dimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.” None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, “Clear!” As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today’s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes. God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this? When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.

“Mike! Thank God you’re still alive. I’m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.”

“What? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?”

“We found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn’t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.” He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.

I frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. “Robert?” I choked the question out in disbelief. He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. “You mean to tell me that all of these guys… They’re all your family?”

Robert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, “I told you we don’t forget Mike. All the Goodings come to Doe’s who wait. ”"
214,OtherJokes,"Two best friends apart This joke about two very good friends who grew up together. Tom and Jim. Tom  decides to go out of the country for work, and asks his best friend Jim to look after his mother and his cat. Jim promises that he will, and that he will write to Tom to keep in touch.

While working overseas Tom gets a letter: 
""Dear Tom, your cat is dead. Jim""

Tom is bewildered with grief and writes back to Jim:

""Dear Jim, is there really no way you could have been a bit more gentle with such news, it came as such shock. 

You could have written me a few letters, something like: Your cat is suddenly often walking on the roofs, and I am worried that he will fall off. 

Then in next letter you tell me that the cat has fallen off the roof, and that the Veterinarians are doing everything they can.

And THEN you conclude in a third letter that the cat has passed away, that way I am prepared for such shock.

Thanks
Tom""

Few weeks later Tom receives a new letter: ""Dear Tom, Sorry I was so insensitive. By the way, Your mum is suddenly often walking high up on the roofs, and I am worried that she will fall off.''"

The usual signs… Phone rings but if I answer, the caller hangs up.

My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently although when I ask their names she always says, “Just some friends from work, you don’t know them.”



I always stay awake to look out for her taxi coming home, but she always walks down the drive. Although I can hear a car driving off, as if she has gotten out of the car round the corner. Why? Maybe she wasn’t in a taxi?



I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went berserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her.



Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my wife I think deep down I just didn’t want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her.



I decided I was going to park my motorcycle next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the whole street when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my bike , that I noticed that the valve covers on my engine seemed to be leaking a little oil.



Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the dealer?

As he was hiking, he noticed an elephant in the distance that had its foot hovering in the air. Not wanting to startle the creature, Joseph slowly made his way toward the elephant. When he got close to the elephant, he noticed a large splinter of wood sticking out from the elephant's foot. Acting carefully, Joseph removed the splinter with his knife. After successfully removing it, the elephant looked at him and stomped its foot several times. Joseph stayed still, with the fear of imminent death. After stomping its foot, the elephant trumpeted loudly and walked away. Joe never forgot that day.

Thirty years later, Joseph was with his family at the Tulsa Zoo when an elephant walked up to Joseph's side of the enclosure and stomped its foot several times. Remembering the incident from thirty years ago, Joseph couldn't help but wonder if this was the same elephant.

Mustering all the courage he had, Joseph climbed over the fence and into the enclosure. He walked up to the elephant and held its gaze for several minutes before the elephant trumpeted. The elephant then wrapped its trunk around Joseph, picked him up, and then slammed him against the fence, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same elephant."

189,OtherJokes,"Irish Economics! It is a slow day in a damp little Irish town. The rain is beating down and the streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.

On this particular day a rich German tourist is driving through the town and he stops at the local hotel and lays a 100 note on the desk. He tells the hotel owner he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.

The owner gives him some keys and, as soon as the visitor has walked upstairs, the hotelier grabs the 100 note and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.100 euro

The butcher takes the 100 note and runs down the street to repay his debt to the pig farmer.

The pig farmer takes the 100 note and heads off to pay his bill at the supplier of feed and fuel.

The guy at the Farmers’ Co-op takes the 100 note and runs to pay his drinks bill at the pub.

The publican slips the money along to the local lady of the night drinking at the bar, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer him “services” on credit.

The lady then rushes to the hotel and pays off her room bill to the hotel owner with the 100 note.

The hotel proprietor then places the 100 note back on the counter so the traveller will not suspect anything. At that moment the traveller comes down the stairs, picks up the 100 note, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money, and leaves town.

No one produced anything. No one earned anything, but the whole town is now out of debt and looking to the future with a lot more optimism."

187,OtherJokes,"Why did the chicken cross the road? The chicken clucked silently to himself as he wiped the rain water from his eyebrows. It has been raining for hours now, but that was good, he would be harder to follow. He breathed in and put his eye to the glass, staring down the scope, using it to peer through the window of the diner across the street. That's where the man sat, the farmer that started it all. He raised him from a chick, fed him, gave him a wife and child.... then took it all away for his own gain. But the chicken wasn't going to let it end like that, oh no. He clucked his final prayer, watched, waited for the rain to fall straight down, a sign of no wind.... and pulled the trigger.

184,AntiJokes,"An American man lives by himself in a beautiful three storey house... One night he's sitting alone watching TV and he hears a knock on the door. He answers it, and there stands a Brit looking slightly anxious and completely drenched from the rain. The Brit speaks

""I'm terribly sorry, but I've just arrived in your country and I'm dreadfully lost. I stumbled upon your house and thought it looked simply breathtaking. I was wondering if you might let me stay here for the night seeing as it's dark out and I don't know where I'm going.""

The American replies, ""Absolutely, it would be nice to have some company around here for a change."" And invites the man in.

The two men have a few drinks, get acquainted and before long it comes time to go to bed. The American says ""there are two bedrooms on each floor of my house, I'm going to sleep in one of the ones on the third floor, would you like to sleep in the other?"" The Brit says that sounds fine and the two men retire to their rooms for the night.

The American is peacefully sleeping away until, at 3am, the Brit runs into the his room, shakes him violently and yells ""There's a fire in my room! Hurry, we have to get out of here!"" 

The American wakes up, and sure enough the other room is on fire. They run downstairs and call the fire dept. who come and put out the fire. 

When things have died down a little, the American begins to think ""Hmmm.. That's strange. I've never had a fire before. Isn't it bizarre that it happens the first night I have this visitor. Oh well, we were both drinking a fair bit, maybe I just left an appliance on accidentally in my haze."" He tells the Brit not to worry about it, ""these things happen"" and sends him on his way.

The next night, the American is once again sitting alone watching TV when again he hears a knock on the door. He goes to answer it, and again sees the Brit there. The Brit asks if he can stay there again since he had such a pleasant time the night before. The American complies, saying ""Certainly, it was a shame about the fire, but it was nice to have the company."" 

The two men again have a few drinks, then to decide to go to bed, this time in the second storey bedrooms (as the third storey ones had burnt down). The American is sound asleep until, again, at 3am, the Brit wakes him up, frantically yelling about a fire in his room. They flee, call the fire dept. who again put out the fire. This time the American is very suspicious of the Brit, but since he doesn't have any solid evidence he again says ""these things happen"" and sends the Brit on his way.

The third night, the Brit returns again asking to stay for the night. The American invites him in and again they commence drinking merrily until it comes time to go to bed (on the first floor). They each go to their bedrooms, but the American decides he wants to catch the Brit red-handed so he sets an alarm for 2:59am. 

He sleeps away until 2:59 rolls around and he's woken up by his alarm. He storms into the other room where he sees, not to his surprise, the Brit lighting a match and setting fire to his curtains. 

He proclaims ""AH HAH! So you *are* the one starting all of these fires!""

And the Brit replies

""Yep."""
184,OtherJokes,"Chinese torture A young man is wandering and lost in a forest when he comes upon a small house. Knocking on the door, he is greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the young man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old, and entered the house. 

During dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. During the night, he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet, so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes, he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought.""If that's the best the old man can do, then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window, and threw the boulder out. 

As he did so, he noticed another note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. 

As he plummeted towards the ground, he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bed post."""

180,OtherJokes,"[OC] An old blacksmith was working in his shop... when there was a terrible accident. The fire in his forge had gone out of control and set fire to the shop. The blacksmith nearly lost his life. He was bedridden for many months and relied on the help of his children and grandchildren to feed him, bathe him, and take care of all of his needs. Eventually he was able to get back on his feet, though his outlook on life had turned quite grim. He was now able to take care of himself, but he had lost much of his strength and dexterity from the injuries he sustained and he was unable to practice his trade. He fell into a deep depression and he spent most of his days sitting at home in front of the fireplace gazing into the flames, longing for the days when his strong hands could grasp a hammer and strike a hot piece of iron, slowly forging it into a beautiful piece of work. 

One evening when the old man was sitting in front of the fire, he heard a knock at the door. It was his granddaughter, whom he hadn't seen in many months. She had overheard her father talking to her mother about how her grandfather was slowly slipping away into depression and hopelessness and she wanted to help. To the old man's surprise, she had brought him a puppy. ""I thought that since you're always here all by yourself that you might want someone you keep you company,"" the granddaughter said. The old man's eyes welled up with tears and the little puppy instantly jumped into his arms and began licking the tears from his face. The old man and his granddaughter spent the next several hours sitting on the floor of his house watching the puppy chase around a rubber ball, bouncing, jumping, panting, and licking. In that short time, the old man had made complete turnaround from being sad, lonely, and hopeless, to smiling from ear to ear, full of joy with his new-found companion. As the hours grew late and the puppy grew tired, the granddaughter said ""Well Opa, I'm glad you like your puppy, but it's late and I should be heading home. By the way, what are you going to call him?"" ""Life,"" said the old man, ""because he has given me a new meaning and joy to mine."" The granddaughter kissed her grandfather on the cheek, wished him goodnight, and she left. 
  
Many years passed and all the while, the old man and his little dog were inseparable. Everywhere the old man went, Life was always with him whether it was the post office, the grocery store, and even when the old man went to the barber shop, the little dog would sit patiently until the last hair on the old man’s head had been cut . The granddaughter would often come to visit to see how her grandfather and the dog were doing, and she was always glad to see that her grandfather was still happy. But at night, the old man would still sit in front of the fireplace with Life on his lap, gazing into the fireplace as flames cast dancing shadows across the room and he fell asleep to thoughts of his old smithing days. 
  
One morning as the old man was getting the morning newspaper from the front porch, Life sprinted past him through the front door because he had spotted a squirrel across the street. Before the little dog could catch up with his prey, a speeding car struck the poor animal. The car came to a screeching halt and the old man hobbled as quickly as his old legs could carry them to his precious companion who lay whimpering on the side of the road. The little dog was alive but badly injured. The man who was driving the car got out to apologize to the old man, but his regrets went unnoticed by the weeping old man who only wanted to tend to his injured dog. Life’s two hind legs appeared limp and broken and the dog panted and whimpered as the old man carried him back into the house. The old man knew that his dog’s injuries required medical attention but because he was out of work, he wasn’t able to afford a veterinarian. Determined, the old man did the only thing he knew how to do. He found some of his old blacksmithing tools and scrap metal from his garage and proceeded to start a fire in his fireplace. His hands lacked the strength and precision they once had but eventually, he was able to forge a crude set of brackets that would hold the dog’s legs in place as his injuries healed. The old man tended to dog’s every need until eventually, Life was able to stand up on his own and soon enough, the dog could walk, and after a few more weeks, he could even manage a awkward, limping run. Unfortunately, the old blacksmith’s craftsmanship was lacking due to his own previous injuries and the braces that he had forged would often break when the dog ran too quickly, so the old man found himself back at the fireplace with his tools forging replacement parts for his little dog’s leg braces. It was tiresome, difficult work with his old frail hands, but he was determined to give his dog the best life that he could, so he kept at it. 
  
One day, as the old man was forging a new set of parts for his dog’s leg braces, an ember jumped from the fireplace, catching the carpet on fire. The old man couldn’t get to the kitchen quickly enough to get a pail of water to put the fire out and tragically, the old blacksmith and his dog both perished as the house was engulfed in flames. 
  
The next day, the granddaughter and her father came to where the old blacksmith’s house once stood and they began to search through the ashes and rubble for anything they could salvage as a keepsake of their lost loved one. “You know,” said the girl to her father, “I’m really happy that grandpa’s last years were as joyful as they were. Even though he was really sad that he couldn’t make a living as a blacksmith anymore, he really did seem happy after I brought him that puppy.” “Yes dear,” said the father.

179,OtherJokes,"There once was a Bulgarian who drove trains for a living... He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""

The first day we had a great time going around las ramblas and going taking pictures at La Sagrada familia. That night we even attended a Barcelona game against Real Madrid. It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman. I said “I’m amazed that a hotel this small has a full time doctor as skilled as yourself!” She replied “no one expects the Spanish inn physician.”

169,OtherJokes,"A priest, a minister, and a rabbi hear about a bear causing trouble in the woods nearby. The three men, friendly rivals, decide among themselves that what this bear needs to be soothed is some religion, so they declare it a contest to see who can convert it. They draw straws, and the Catholic priest is the first to try.

He heads into the woods, and comes back three hours later with a few claw swipes across his face and hands, and tells the other two, ""I read from the Catechism, and the bear seemed to enjoy that, but when I sprinkled him with holy water, he tried to maul me, and I ran!""

The Protestant minister is the second to go, and he's gone all evening, meeting his friends the next afternoon, with a bandage around his head and a broken leg. He says to them, ""I found the bear by the river, and I preached to him from God's holy word, and he was as gentle as a lamb, until I tried to baptize him in the river; he nearly bit my head off and I had to bolt for my life!""

Lastly went the Jewish Rabbi, off into the woods. His friends hear nothing from him for two days, until they receive the word that he's in hospital. They rush over to find him in the ICU, a cast covering most of his body, and vicious wounds all over the rest of him. They frantically ask him what happened, and between laboured breaths through the ventilator, he mutters, ""You know, thinking about it, I probably shouldn't've opened with the circumcision.."""

167,OtherJokes,"Square Testicles An elderly woman walked into the Royal Bank of Ireland one morning with a purse full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.
 
After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.
 
The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.
 
The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.
 
The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'
 
The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'
 
The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.         
The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'
 
'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'
 
'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.
 
That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.
 
The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square.
 
The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.
 
The president was happy to oblige.
 
The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked   the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'
 
The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland.'"

A billionaire throws a party for the whole town. He has everything a billionaire could possibly have including: tennis courts, go cart track, mini-golf, private airplane, and a huge mansion. The main attraction however is the biggest swimming pool you've ever seen, and inside that pool, the worlds biggest alligator.


At the end of the party he makes a announcement, 'Before everyone leaves Id like to make a challenge, Whoever can swim across my swimming pool without getting eaten by the alligator can have one of three things. (1. A billion dollars) (2. Half my estate) (or 3. My daughters hand in marriage). No one however has the guts to do so and the party ends and everyone goes home.


The very next year he throws another party's just like the first and at the very end he challenges someone to the same challenge as before. However no one has the guts the 2nd year either and everyone leaves.


The third year comes and he decides to throw one more party, and at the end of the party he gives his challenge one more time. Just as he is finishing saying what he will give the lucky guy who can swim across, He hears a splash of someone jumping in. He looks over to see this guy swimming as fast as he possibly can across the pool with the alligator chasing after him. Everyone in town is cheering him on as the alligator is snapping it's jaw at his feet. The man reaches the end of the pool and 3 men pull him up as the alligator snaps his shoe off.


The billionaire rushes over and he exclaims, 'THAT WAS THE BRAVESET THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! Which choice do you want out of the three?!?! The man is breathing so heavily he can't speak. The bilionare asks, 'Do you want a billion dollars?' The man replies with heavy breathing 'No no No'. The billionaire responds with 'You're a smart man you must want half my estate'.

160,AntiJokes,"How do you catch a polar bear? First, one must determine a reasonable location in which to expect polar bears to be lurking.  They are generally found in Arctic regions.  Second, you'll need to distribute a number of well-camouflaged bear traps, such as the one [pictured here](http://chanteepps.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bear-trap.jpg) in areas that one might expect polar bears to be searching for food.  Since they are carnivores, one can expect them [primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear#Hunting_and_diet).  This will pose a challenge to some, but it can be done.  

The next crucial step is to monitor the traps from a safe distance, as these bears can be quite dangerous.  Additionally, should you luck out and snare one, caution should be taken not to allow enough time to pass that the bear either starves or gnaws its leg off in order to escape.  It would be prudent to shoot the animal with a tranquilizer potent enough to render it safely unconscious without risking a fatal overdose.  

It is crucial to keep in mind that the polar bear is an apex predator, meaning they have no natural prey and they play a role in keeping their own prey in check from a population standpoint; any drastic shift in the predator/prey dynamic can have unintended consequences upon the environment and negative effects on other species, as well as the indigenous peoples who hunt them.  

Finally, it should be noted that polar bears are considered a threatened species under the [Endangered Species Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act) and, as such, you may be breaking the law by attempting to trap or kill such an animal.  Violations of this law could result in steep penalties for the person in question, and trapping of polar bears should therefore be avoided entirely, for legal reasons if not ethical ones.

159,AntiJokes,"Searched, but didn't see my favourite anti-joke anywhere here I was told this in high school by a good friend of mine. It is  supposed to be the longest joke in the world. It's going to be **very very** long. Just did a word count online: 2800 words. You've been warned.

There once was a bright kingdom, with a great King, it a very large castle. He had a beautiful daughter, who all of the Knights wished to marry. When she came of age, many Knights asked for her hand. The King, being a great King, allowed her to choose her own suitor. But one by one, all of the knights were turned down.

One day a young, young squire ran to the castle. He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

""Halt, who goes there?"" asked the guards in unison.

""It is I, the King's squire, here to deliver unto him an important message,"" said the squire.

""And what is the message?"" one asked.

""The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" both guards gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

So the guards let him pass. The drawbridge was lowered, and the squire ran to the throne room. The drawbridge clacked shut behind him. At the door he was stopped by the Herald.

""Who goes there?"" asked the Herald.

""It is I,"" said the squire, ""the King's squire. I have for him a message.""

""And it is?"" asked the Herald.

""""The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the herald gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

So the Herald opened the door and blared his trumpet.

""Announcing the King's squire, travelling to give the King an important message!""

The squire scurried into the room and kneeled before the great King.

""Speak!"" bellowed the King.

""It is I, your squire, my Lord. I am here to deliver unto you an important message,"" said the squire.

""Get on with it already,"" said the King.

""My liege. The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the King gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

Just then there was a ruckus at the drawbridge. Faintly, the king could hear the guardsmen shouting something.

Distantly, the sound of the drawbridge lowering cut through the air. 

Through the door the King heard the Herald.

""Halt! What business have you with the King?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, and I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage.""

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" gasped the Herald.

""Yes, the Black Black Knight,"" he said, ""Now get out of my way before I kill you.""

The door was kicked open and a seven-foot tall man clad in armour blacker than the moonless night sky strode before the great King. He didn't bother kneeling.

""Insolence!"" cried the King, ""What business have you here?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, and I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage.""

""No, not the Black Black Knight,"" gasped the King.

""Yes, the Black Black Knight,"" he said, ""now let me see your daughter before I kill you.""

""Fine,"" said the great King. ""She is at the top of the longest staircase in the tallest tower, guarded by a magical portrait.""

So the Black Black Knight headed for the tower. He climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed. And then he climbed some more. Finally, after a day's march, he came to a magical, moving portrait. 

""State your business with the Princess,"" said the portrait.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the portrait gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.""

""Fine,"" said the portrait, and swung aside revealing a doorway.

As he stepped through, the Princess, shocked, screeched and backed against the wall.

""Who are you, and how did you get in here?!"" she cried.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to ask for the your hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" she gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now, give me an answer.""

""Well,"" said the Princess, obviously distraught. ""I've never met you nor do I know if the tales about you are true. I believe a husband should be strong, and brave and able to protect me from anything. And I need proof. Go to the Red Mountain of the South, defeat the ruby red dragon and bring me back a ruby red dragon scale.""

""Fine, I shall fetch you your trinket. And then you will give me an answer,"" said the Black Black Knight.

So the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the base of the Red Mountain of the South.

He looked around for days, then weeks, until he finally found a hidden cave entrance. He went inside and noticed it was incredibly hot. Gouts of flame shot from the ground, and from fissures in the walls.

""Sssssstop,"" said a booming, serpentine voice, ""who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the ruby red dragon, and bring a ruby red scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the dragon gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.""

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for a whole day. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the ruby red dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's neck. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom, riding for days and days and days without rest.

He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

""Halt, who goes there?"" asked the guards in unison.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight here to deliver the Princess her trinket,"" said the Black Black Knight.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" both guards gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.

So the guards let him pass. The drawbridge was lowered, and the Black Black Knight walked to the throne room. The drawbridge clacked shut behind him. At the door he was stopped by the Herald.

""Who goes there?"" asked the Herald.

""It is I,"" said the Knight, ""the Black Black Knight. I have the princess' trinket.""

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the herald gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.""

So the Herald opened the door and blared his trumpet.

""Announcing the Black Black Knight, he who rode to the Red Mountain of the South and defeated the ruby red drag on has come bearing its scale for the Princess!""

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the King gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" the Knight confirmed. ""Now let me see the Princess before I kill you.""

So the Black Black Knight headed for the tower. He climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed. And then he climbed some more. Finally, after a day's march, he came to a magical, moving portrait. 

""State your business with the Princess,"" said the portrait.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have ridden to the Red Mountain of the South, defeated the ruby red dragon, and I am here to deliver its ruby red scale, that I may earn the Princess' hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.""

""Fine,"" said the portrait, and swung aside revealing a doorway.

He stepped inside and the Princess turned to see him.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have ridden to the Red Mountain of the South, defeated the ruby red dragon, and I am here to deliver its ruby red scale, that I may earn your hand in marriage,"" he said.

""So you fought it and killed it in fair battle, did you?"" she asked.

""I did,"" said the Black Black Knight.

""Well,"" said the Princess. ""It's impressive, but I thought the scale would be bigger. It couldn't have been too hard. I don't know if I can trust you to protect me. Go, ride to the Blue Cave of the North, do battle with the sapphire blue dragon, and bring me a sapphire blue scale. Only then will I know you're worthy.""

""Fine,"" said the Black Black Knight, ""and then you will give me an answer.""

So the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the mouth of the Blue Cave of the North.

He looked around for days, then weeks, until he finally found a hidden cave entrance. He went inside and noticed that the walls and floor were all very icy and slippery. His armour was forming frost just by being there. 

""Sssssstop,"" said a booming, serpentine voice, ""who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the sapphire blue dragon, and bring a sapphire blue scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the dragon gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.""

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for two whole days. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the sapphire blue dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's chest. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom, riding for days and days and days without rest.

He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

""Halt, who goes there?"" asked the guards in unison.

""Fine,"" said the Black Black Knight, ""and then you will give me an answer.""

So the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the edge of the Emerald Forest of the East.

He looked around for days, then weeks, until he found a barely used path that wound through the forest for a very long time. He looked around and noticed everything was dense and overgrown. 

""Sssssstop,"" said a booming, serpentine voice, ""who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the emerald green dragon, and bring a emerald green scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.""

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for three whole days. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the emerald green dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's chest.

158,OtherJokes,"An Army general, an Air Force general and a Navy admiral were having lunch and talking at the officers club when the topic of bravery came up in their conversation. The Air Force man said that the men in the Air Force were the bravest of all the U.S. troops. The Army man said: ""That's bullshit, everyone knows the Army has the bravest men serving the country. The admiral blurted out that they were both full of shit and that everyone in the country knew that the U.S. sailors were the bravest of our fighting men.

The three bickered back and forth for some time and finally agreed that they should put their men to the test, which they would personally monitor.

First they went to the airbase where they boarded a bomber that was scheduled to make some practice bombing runs. They were about to come over the target when the Air Force general walked up to one of the crew and said: ""airman, I want you to ride that bomb down right to the dead center of that target."" Without hesitation, the airman saluted the general, climbed aboard the bomb, released the holding mechanism and rode the bomb right to the dead center of the target and was blown all to hell. The Air Force general looked at his friends and said: ""that's bravery.""

Their next stop was the Army camp where they were holding maneuvers to practice heavy armor tactics. The Army general walks up to one of his men and said, while pointing to a tank speeding toward them, ""Private stop that tank."" The Soldier ran toward the tank waving his arms and yelling ""STOP, STOP"" and was flattened flatter than a pancake. The Army man looked at his friends and said: ""that's bravery"".

The three adjourned for a quick drink and proceeded to the Admiral's flagship and went all the way up to the Admiral's bridge. When they had arrived on the bridge the three looked up and saw a man painting the mast way above them. 

The Admiral yelled out: ""Hey, you there aloft."" The seaman painting the mast looked down, saluted and replied: ""Yes sir"". The Admiral yelled up: ""Jump off that mast sailor""! The sailor, without any hesitation, flipped the Admiral the bird and said, ""Fuck you sir""."

Thankfully, with him is a young deacon in training, so the priest whispers to him,
""listen, I need you to take over a few of these confessions for me while I duck off to the bathroom, I'll only be gone a few minutes.""

""But father!"" Says the deacon in a hushed panic,
""I don't know what to do! We haven't learned confessions in the seminary yet!""

""Don't worry, it's easy,"" replies the priest.
""just look here at this list on the wall. Whatever their sins are, just find it on the list and it will show the appropriate penance. The people confessing won't even see you from behind the screen anyway, you'll be fine. I'll be back soon.""

So the first punter walks in to the booth and the nervous deacon opens the screen. The man confesses to be stealing money from his work. The deacon looks down the list, and sure enough finds ""stealing - 2 hail Marys,"" gives him his penance and sends him on his way.

The second person walks in, a man claiming to have problems with anger, and that he struck his wife the other day.
The deacon looks down the list, and finds ""hitting - 1 Our Father.""
Tells the man to say 1 Our father as penance, and sends him on his way.

A woman then enters. 

""Forgive me father, for I have sinned. I'm married, but I gave a blowjob to another man.""


The deacon scrolls down the list... blowjob... blowjob... no blowjob. He doesn't know what to do, it isn't on the list.
The deacon begins to panic, but luckily he then notices an altar boy is nearby, so he whispers to him.

""Pssst, listen I need to know something, what does father give for a blowjob?""

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150."""

So he reluctantly goes to the bar and, miraculously, he finds a woman who loves tractors too. (Not as much as him, though because NO-ONE loves tractors as much as this guy). But he meets this girl who loves tractors enough to stimulate him, intellectually.

145,OtherJokes,"Mama's Bible Four brothers left home for college, and they became successful doctors
and lawyers.

One evening, they chatted after having dinner together. 

They discussed the 95th birthday gifts they were able to give their elderly
mother who moved to Florida .

The first said, ""You know I had a big house built for Mama.""

The second said, ""And I had a large theater built in the house.""

The third said, ""And I had my Mercedes dealer deliver an SL600 to her.""

The fourth said, ""You know how Mama loved reading the Bible and you know
she can't read anymore because she can't see very well.  I met this 
preacher who told me about a parrot who could recite the entire Bible. It took
ten preachers almost 8 years to teach him. I had to pledge to contribute
$50,000 a year for five years to the church, but it was worth it. 
Mama only has to name the chapter and verse, and the parrot will recite it.""

The other brothers were impressed. After the celebration Mama sent out
her ""Thank You"" notes.

She wrote: Milton , the house you built is so huge that I live in only one
room, but I have to clean the whole house. Thanks anyway."" 
 
""Michael, you gave me an expensive theater with Dolby sound and it can
hold 50 people, but all of my friends are dead, I've lost my hearing, 
and I'm nearly blind. I'll never use it. Thank you for the gesture just the 
same."" 

""Marvin, I am too old to travel. I stay home; I have my groceries
delivered, so I never use the Mercedes. The thought was good. Thanks.""

""Dearest Melvin, you were the only son to have the good sense to give 
a little thought to your gift. That chicken was delicious. Thank you so much.""

Love, Mama"

142,OtherJokes,"A prison decides to renovate its showers An ageing prison facility is constantly beset by long queues for the shower area, which the managers decide to do something about because having all the prisoners together in one area outside of their cells might get nasty. So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.

So they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn't do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.

When the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed. However, the moment they are disconnected, there's a massive electricity failure throughout the entire complex, leading to all the prisoners escaping due to lack of electric security systems.

Of course, the managers are outraged, and start shouting at the technician: ""What the hell did you do? I told you to remove those damn drying boxes, not let all the inmates escape!""

The technician says, calmly, ""I thought you knew what would happen if those drying machines were removed...""

This does nothing to assuage the managers' anger, and they keep demanding an explanation as to why they should have know that there would be a power cut. After several minutes of argument, they finally get one.

""Don't you remember?"", says the technician. ""The mighty con drier is the powerhouse of the cell..."""

The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed, pointing out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.
The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'
The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.
She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'
To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'
'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.
'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'

When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.""

But the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.

Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company's secret files.

From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.

Without even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other fire
fighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.

Within a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.

The local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, ""What are you going to do with all that money?""

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

127,OtherJokes,"If this doesn't bring a tear to your eyes you must have a heart made of stone. In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University.

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

127,OtherJokes,"Three couples walk into a church... One is an elderly pair, the second pair a little younger and finally the third a couple of newlyweds. They meet with the pastor, a strict but amicable looking man. The three couples tell the pastor they want to join his congregation. 

He gives them a big grin and replies, ""Of course you may, but all of our new members must first pass a single test. If you can successfully abstain from sex for two weeks, we will welcome you with open arms."" 

Sure enough, they all agree to follow the pastor's instructions and leave. Two weeks later they're all back at the church. 

The pastor first asks the elderly couple how it went. The husband replies, ""Eh, it wasn't too hard.    At our age, sex is more of an accident."" The pastor tells them they're welcome to his congregation. 

He then turns to the younger couple and asks them the same question. The husband replies, ""The first week was easy. The second.. Well I had to sleep on the couch, but we made it."" The pastor welcomes them to the church, too. 

Finally, he turns to the young couple and asks them about their two weeks. The husband replies, ""Well, we were doing fine, honest, until she reached up a high shelf to grab a can of red paint. She was wearing this really short skirt and I couldn't very well control myself. We did it then and there.""

122,OtherJokes,"A young man went off to college.... A young man from Arkansas goes off to college. Half way through the semester, having foolishly squandered all of his money on his girlfriend, he calls home.

""Dad,"" he says, ""You won't believe what modern education is developing! They actually have a program here at Hendrix that will teach our dog, Ole' Blue how to talk!""

""That's amazing,"" his Dad says. ""How do I get Ole' Blue in that program?""

""Just send him over here with $1,000"" the young Arkie says ""and I'll get him in the course.""

So, his Father sends the dog and $1,000.

About two-thirds of the way through the semester, the money again runs out. The boy calls home.

""So how's Ole' Blue doing son?"" his Father asks.

""Awesome, Dad, he's talking up a storm,"" he says, ""but you just won't believe this -- they've had such good results they have started to teach the animals how to read!""

""Read!?"" says his Father, ""No kidding! How do we get Blue in that program?""

""Just send $2,500, I'll get him in the class.""

The money promptly arrives. The Arkie and his girlfriend are able to buy enough dank to last the whole semester. But our hero has a problem. At the end of the year, his Father will find out the dog can neither talk, nor read. Even though he was always pretty much able to lie his way out of trouble, the Arkie asked his girlfriend to help him think of a really good lie to tell his Dad. She very quickly came up with a plan for him.

So she has him shoot the dog.

When he arrives home at the end of the year, his Father is all excited.

""Where's Ole' Blue? I just can't wait to see him read something and talk!""

""Dad,"" the boy says, ""I have some grim news. Yesterday morning, just before we left to drive home, Ole' Blue was in the living room, kicked back in the recliner, reading the Wall Street Journal, like he usually does"".

""Then Ole' Blue turned to me and asked, so, is your Daddy still messing around with that little redhead who lives down the street?""

The Father went white and exclaimed, ""I hope you shot that lying damn dog before he talks to your Mother!""

""I sure did, Dad!""

Doctor: He then saw a bear. Not knowing what to do, he opened the umbrella, and poof, the bear died.

Old Man: How's that possible? You can't kill a bear with an umbrella

107,OtherJokes,"Last week was my 40th birthday. I really didn't feel like waking up that morning. I managed to pull myself together and go downstairs for breakfast, hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember. 

My kids came trampling down the stairs to breakfast, ate their breakfast, and didn't say a word to me. So when I made it out of the house and started for work, I felt pretty dumpy and despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Joanne said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a bit better knowing that at least someone remembered. I worked in a zombie like fashion until about one o'clock, when Joanne knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your Birthday, why don't we go out for lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""Thanks, Joanne, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go!"" 

We went to lunch but not where we'd normally go. Instead she took me to a quiet bistro with a private table. We had a couple of mixed drinks and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Joanne said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't have to go right back to the office, do we?"" I replied with ""I suppose not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment, it's just around the corner."" 

After arriving at her apartment, Joanne turned to me and said, ""Boss if you don't mind, I'm goinna to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back."" ""Ok."" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... 

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends, and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"". 

And I just sat there...

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”

The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door.

The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”

The man is relieved to no end.

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk."

One day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.

The young family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.

Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough,” more or less, adopted her as a project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.

At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars. The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.

When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

The little girl proudly replied,  “I worked last week with a real work crew building the new house next door to us.”

“Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week too?”

The little girl replied, “I will if those assholes at Home Depot ever deliver the f**king sheet rock…”

He remembers the looks on the boy's faces when they walked into that village and... oh Jesus. He shouldn't think about that now. Sometimes he still hears Tex's slow southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes. He always had a pack of Luckys. But the boys are gone now... he knows that. It's--it's just that he forgets sometimes. And sometimes the way that seven looks at him... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. And he feels like he's back there... In the jungle... In the darkness.

""Is there a problem, Officer?""

The policeman says, ""Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your license please?""

The driver responds, ""I'd give it to you but I don't have one.""

""You don't have one?""

The man responds, ""I lost it four times for drink driving.""

The policeman is shocked. ""I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?""

""I'm sorry, I can't do that.""

The policeman says, ""Why not?""

""I stole this car.""

The officer says, ""Stole it?""

The man says, ""Yes, and I killed the owner.""

At this point the officer is getting irate. ""You what?""

""She's in the boot if you want to see.""

The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun.

The senior officer says, ""Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!""

The man steps out of his vehicle. ""Is there a problem, sir?""

""One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.""

""Murdered the owner?""

The officer responds, ""Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please?""

The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.

The officer says, ""Is this your car sir?""

The man says, ""Yes"" and hands over the registration papers.

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. ""One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.""

The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. ""Thank you, sir. One of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, and murdered the owner.""

The man replies, ""I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too!"""

99,OtherJokes,"The Harley Davidson (NSFW) There's this man, let's call him Greg, who has wanted a 1979 Harley Davidson Ironhead 1000 Kickstart his whole life. (It's rare, about 160 made.) After getting  engaged to the love of his life, he decides to find one. After some searching, he finds one for only $500. Immediately, he calls the owner and sets up a time to come look at the bike. 

Upon arrival, Greg meets this old man and asks him about the bike. The old man just smiles as he opens the garage and reveals the Harley in perfect showroom condition. Astonished, Greg asks the man how he kept the bike looking so new. With a chuckle, the old man says, ""it's an old family secret. Every time it's going to rain, I coat every inch of the bike in Vasoline. The water runs right off and keeps the bike looking new."" Greg gives the man the money and loads the bike up. 

After getting it home, he starts the bike up and takes off to pick up his fiancée to have dinner with her parents, stopping to get some Vasoline for the bike. 

When they arrive, she stops him at the doorstep and says, ""there's something you need to know about my family. Nobody talks during dinner. Whoever speaks first has to wash all the dishes."" Greg nods and they go inside. 

He's met with an entryway that has a tiny path leading inside.  On either side of the path are dishes stacked floor to ceiling. As he walks further into the house he sees the living room filled with dishes, floor to ceiling, except for a tiny path to the couch and between the couch and TV. The stairs, the halfway, the rooms, all riddled with dishes floor to ceiling. 

When dinner starts, everyone sits down and starts eating, and sure enough, nobody says a word. 

About five minutes in, Greg thinks, *I can have fun with this* and reaches over and grabs his fiancée's titty. 

The father glares at him, the mother acts like she didn't see anything, but sure enough, nobody says a word. 

Delighted by this reaction, Greg grabs his fiancée, throws her on the table, rips off her pants and begins fucking her right in the table. 

The father is fuming, the mother gasps loudly, but... nobody says a word. 

Greg sits back down and begins to eat again. After several more minutes, he decides to go even further and reaches over and grabs the mother's titty, throws her on the table, and behind fucking her. 

The father clenched his fists, turns multiple shades of red, veins pop out of his forehead. The anger can be felt for miles. 

But, nobody says a word.

Exhausted, Greg begins to eat again, but suddenly hears a loud clap of thunder in the distance. As the old man's words echo in his head, he stands up and pulls out his jar of Vasoline. 

Suddenly, the father slams his hands on the table and shouts, ""Alright, enough! I'll do the goddamned dishes! """

Then a louder knock follows. ""Aren't you going to answer that?"" says his wife. So he drags himself out of bed and goes downstairs. He opens the door and there is a man standing on the porch. It didn't take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk. 
""Hi there,"" slurs the stranger. ""Can you give me a push??"" 
""No, get lost! It's half past three. I was in bed,"" says the man and he slams the door. He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says, ""That wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter and you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? What would have happened if he'd told us to get lost?"" 
""But the guy was drunk,"" says the husband. ""It doesn't matter,"" says the wife. ""He needs our help and it would be the Christian thing to help him."" 
So the husband gets out of bed again, gets dressed, and goes downstairs. He opens the front door, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts, ""Hey, do you still want a push?"" And he hears a voice cry out, ""Yeah, please."" So, still being unable to see the stranger he shouts, ""Where are you?""

And the drunk replies, ""Over here, on the swing.

96,AntiJokes,"Pink Bicycle (warning: wall of text anti-joke) For his sixth birthday a father gave his son a pink bicycle. The son was confused and asked his father why it was pink. The father just looked at the son and said ""I'll tell you when you're older"". The kid asked again, as kids are wont to do ""I'm older now, can you tell me?"" The reply was as expected ""No son, I mean really older, now go ride your bike."" So the son did go ride the bike anyway, even though it was pink and he got a bit of flak from his friends for it. After a few days he hid the bike in the back of the garage, told his dad it had been stolen by a bully and promptly forgot about it. Until his next birthday. This time he got a video game from his father and all was alright, but it brought up the question again. ""Dad? Why did you get me a pink bicycle last year for my birthday?"" The dad got a little upset and spewed the same old line ""I'll tell you when you're older."" This same scene played out on the eighth birthday as it brought back the memory of the pink bicycle. And again on the ninth and so on until the son moved out for college and he rarely returned for his birthdays. Occasionally he'd remember the pink bicycle and be reminiscent and still often confused as to why his father gave him a pink bicycle, but never quite found the time to call him up and ask something that was now so trivial. Years pass, the son grows up and has a wonderful life and as time often does it wears on the years of age and the father gets old and ill, on his deathbed. The son is having to prepare his old childhood home for the father's eventual passing, so is having a garage sale. He comes across the pink bike in the back of the garage. Laughing to himself, he decides not to sell it, but it does bring back the old question, so later that day while visiting his father in the hospital he asks. ""Father, it's been forty years. I'm sufficiently old enough now. Will you finally tell me the question that's plagued me my entire life? Why, on my sixth birthday, did you get me a pink bicycle?"" The father, laughing a bit, simply nods and smiles with joy at his son. He agrees, it's finally time to explain. ""Son. You know I love you very much. You know I'm quite proud of you and all you've done with your life. I told you when you were six that I'd tell you when you're older."" he wheezes with his bad lung, the pause causes some anxiety with the son giving just the proper dramatic effect. ""The reason son,"" he coughs, ""the reason I got you a pink bicycle when you were six--"" The father coughs again. Pausing to catch his breath, but he can't catch it. He stops breathing and the doctors and nurses all rush in to try to save him. It is to no avail and the father dies there in the hospital. The son makes the final arrangements, goes back home to stare at the pink bicycle he'd rescued from the back of his father's old garage. He never found out why his father had given it to him.

95,OtherJokes,"Donkey weatherman Once upon a time there was a king who wanted to go fishing. He called the royal weather forecaster and inquired as to the weather forecast for the next few hours. The weatherman assured him that there was no chance of rain in the coming days.
So the king went fishing with his wife, the queen.

On the way he met a farmer on his donkey. Upon seeing the king the farmer said, ""Your Majesty, you should return to the palace at once because in just a short time I expect a huge amount of rain to fall in this area"".
The king was polite and considerate, he replied: ""I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an extensively educated and experienced professional, and I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way."" So they did.
However, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition.

Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to execute the weatherman at once! He summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster.

The farmer said, ""Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see his ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain."" So the King hired the donkey on the spot.

And thus began the ancient practice of hiring asses to work in government and occupy its highest and most influential positions.."

88,OtherJokes,"A woman is sunbathing ... [nsfw] On a hot summers day, a woman lies in her backyard sunbathing. She wants a nice, even tan and since her yard has a high fence around it so she decides to strip naked. 

With the warm sun on her skin and all the sounds of a hot summers day she starts drifting into sleep.

Suddenly she comes fully awake to the sensation of something crawling up her inner thigh! Still groggy she tries to determine what it is, and to her horror she sees the end of a bee disappear into her vagina!

Half panicking she throws on some clothes and heads for her doctor. When the doctor enters the examination room, she explains her predicament and her worry. 

""And you're sure the bee is still inside you?""

""Of course I am! What am I supposed to do about it?!""

""Don't worry, just call your husband and have him meet you at home. Take some honey and cover the tip of his penis with it and let him enter you slowly. When he feels the bee eating the honey, just have him exit you real slow and pull the bee with him!""

Amazingly this plan calmed the woman some, but it had a huge flaw:

""I'm not married, and I have no boyfriend!""

""Don't you have any close friends you could ask to help you?""

""I don't have time for that, can't you do it? It's your plan and everything!""

""Hmm, well I guess the situation is quite time dependent. Lay here on the bed and uncover yourself while I get some honey.""

As the woman got situated the doctor got a bottle of honey from the lunch room. When he returned he took out his penis and covered the tip. Slowly he entered the woman until he was almost completely inside her.

""There he is! He just started eating the honey.""

""Great! Does he stick to you when you pull out?""

""No, he keeps dropping off!""

So, the doctor goes slowly forward and backward and forward and backward trying to pull out the bee, he's getting more and more frustrated since the bee seems to go nowhere. Suddenly he increases his speed to a fast pace.

""What are you doing?! He'll never stick when you're going this fast!""

""I changed my mind, I'll shoot that son of a bitch!"""

The Chief of MI6 had one final test. A test that would surely be able to leave them with one man at the most.

He invites the Englishman to a room, this room had two doors, one where they entered and another directly behind the chief. In the middle, between the doors was a desk, where the Chief sat.

""Morning lad"", Said the director, ""What exactly are you prepared to do for your country?""

""Anything you tell me to do"", he said proudly.

""Good."", the chief responded. He slid a handgun across the desk, toward the recruit.

""Your wife is in the next room. I want you to go in there and kill her.""

The young man took the gun and slowly walked in the room. Minutes pass, and he eventually walks out and gives the weapon back.

""I'm sorry, I can't do it. I've just married her and I can't let her go.""

""That's fine,"" the Director answered. ""You're excused.""

The Irishman comes in next, an older chap. The same scenario plays out, gun is handed to him, he is told his wife is in the next room, he enters and shuts the door behind himself and after a few minutes pass he eventually comes out.

""I can't do it"", says the older recruit, ""I've been married for two years, she's my wife and the mother of my children.""

The director excuses him, and in comes the Scotsman.

""We have one last test"", Said the director.

""Yeah, what is it, then?"", he said.

He slides the gun across the desk. ""Your wife is in the next room. Go kill her.""

""The misses?"" He asked.

The director nodded. The * went in the room, closed the door, and barely time has passed before shots are heard.

BANG... BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG

A few more seconds pass.

Outside their respective temples, they prefer not to emphasise their daytime spiritual services, and will not be subject to such ridicule. Rather, they view themselves as three friends, companions if you will, and they all silently acknowledge the beauty that is acceptance of each other despite considerable differences in religious practise.

Slightly offended, they once again find themselves outside the bar, contemplating alternate ways to spend what remains of their evening."

A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?""

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.""

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.""

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.""

In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.

As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost."""

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.
As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""
I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""
After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""
""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.
Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"". And I just sat there...

Joseph had got glass in his left eye, rendering the eye completely useless. He had to walk around for months with one of those cotton patches on while it healed. Then out of nowhere this bastard just disappeared... With my girlfriend!

Apparently through his struggling time after the injuries, they had became very close, they left me behind without as much as even a single note. I tried tracking them down through out the years but I've had no such luck.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.""

Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:
""Guys, I think I fucked up."""

One day Tyrone's mother came to the school to check on her son, and his teacher told her that he was a disaster, always had bad grades, and was probably the dumbest kid she ever taught.  Tyrone's mother was so furious she removed Tyrone from the Detroit school and they moved to Cleveland.

25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with an almost incurable cardiac disease.  All of her doctors advised her that she needed heart surgery, but the only one able to do it was a doctor in Cleveland.  Since she had no other options she decided to have the operation and it was successful.

When she opened her eyes she saw a handsome young doctor smiling down at her. She wanted to thank him, but she couldn't talk.  Her face started to turn blue, and she raised her hand as if she was trying to tell the doctor something but quickly died.  

The doctor was shocked and wondered what went wrong so suddenly.  Then he turned around and saw our friend Tyrone, the janitor at the clinic, who had unplugged her life support equipment in order to connect his vacuum cleaner.

I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry and that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to give it a try again. 

Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food had poisoned me. I told her no; I had stopped in the middle of the parking lot to lick my balls and a car hit me.

74,AntiJokes,"The Blue Joke A man was driving along a deserted country road, there's thick scrub either side and he's doing about 110km/h. All of a sudden, the scrub clears up ahead and he's confronted by the strangest thing he has ever seen - off to the left is a big, blue house. 

The blue house is surrounded by blue trees, blue grass and has a blue fence. Overawed by the sight of all this blue, and questioning his own sanity, the man failed to notice the bend coming up and crashed off the road, into a ditch. 

Seeing as apart from this house, he's in the middle of nowhere with no mobile reception, he figures he has no other choice but to go up to this creepy blue house. He walks through the blue gate, up the blue driveway and knocks on the blue door. 

An elderly lady, wearing a blue dress, blue slippers and blue earrings opens the door, ""Hello.."" she said.

""Hi madam, I've just crashed my car across the road, and I wondered if I could come in and call the towing company. I really hope you don't mind."" 

""Oh, of course"" she replied, ""the phone's this way.""

The man walked through the blue door, into the blue kitchen - noting the blue tiled floor, blue fridge and blue cupboards, and picks up the blue phone. Not wanting to offend the kind lady, he does not question the obsession with blue. While on the phone to the towing company, he discovers that a tow truck cannot be sent until the following morning. He relays this news to the lady, and she offers him a room to stay in overnight.

The man walked up the blue stairs, through another blue door into the spare bedroom. He lies down on the blue bed, under the blue bedspread, and drifts off to sleep looking at the blue ceiling.

A few minutes later, another man is driving along the same country road. He too, is overawed by the blue estate confronting him, and, despite noticing the turn, cannot control his car and careers off into the same ditch. He walks up to the blue house, speaks to the lady dressed in blue and calls the same towing company with the same blue phone. He is given the same news as the previous man, and is offered a room by the old lady.

He walks into his blue bedroom, walking across the blue carpet, tossing his keys on the blue side table and drifting off to sleep in his blue bed.

Meanwhile, a third gentlemen is driving down the road, and, noting the two cars in a ditch, drives far more carefully. However, he is incredibly fatigued and has a microsleep at the wheel, causing his car to run off the road into a tree, and down an embankment. He is fine, as is the car, however he will require the services of the tow truck too. He walks back up, and notices the big blue house. After deep consideration to ascertain whether he had suffered a mild brain injury or not (despite the low speed and glancing impact of the crash), he decides approaching the blue gate, to walk up to the blue door is the best option.

He uses the blue knocker, and the kindly old lady, still dressed in her blue outfit, opens the door. 

""Can I guess"" she begins ""you've crashed your car and need to call the repairman?""

The man says yes, and goes inside, along the blue hallway, into the blue kitchen with a blue phone, blue MixMaster and blue microwave oven. 

""He won't be here until morning, the other two gentlemen have already called. I know how it sounds though, an old lady in the middle of nowhere offering you a place to stay overnight - call the company, their frustration doesn't outweigh your peace of mind.""

He calls the towing company, and they confirm the veracity of the lady's comments. He walks up the blue stairs, having already consumed a glass of water from a blue glass, and enters the third blue spare room. He collapses on the blue bed, staring up at the blue ceiling, and, fatigued from his drive, promptly falls asleep.

In the morning, each of the three men walk downstairs, exchange pleasantries and make small talk. They sit down at the blue table, and the old lady - wearing a different blue dress, blue shoes and blue earrings, pulls out some blue bowls and places them on the table. She asks the men what they would like for breakfast, as the towing company pulls the three cars back on to the road.

""I'll have some Weetabix, please"" says the first.
""I wouldn't mind some cornflakes, if that's alright"" says the second.
""I think I'll go with Weetabix too, please"" says the third.

When they woke up, they were at the leader of the tribe's throne.
The chief then said ""All of your lives may be spared if you can find ten of one fruit and bring them back to me.""
So after a while the first man returned with 10 apples. The cheif then ordered him to stick all ten of them up his butt without making any expression at all on his face. He had a little bit of trouble with the first one and started crying while trying to put the next one in. He was soon killed.
Later, the next guy came in with 10 grapes. The cheif soon ordered him to do the same as the first guy. After to the 9th grape, the man started laughing so hard for no apperant reason, and was killed.
The first two guys soon met in heaven and the first guy ask the second, ""Why did you start laughing? You only needed one more grape and you'd have gotten away!""
The second guy answered while still laughing, ""I couldn't help it. I saw the third guy walking in with pineapples."""

73,OtherJokes,"Three men stand at the Pearly Gates Saint Peter explains to them that unfortunately Heaven is rather overcrowded at the moment, so they're only letting in people with the most horrific deaths.  One by one he asks them each how they perished.

The first man: I live on the 6th floor of an apartment building in Manhattan, and for some months now I've been suspecting that my wife has been cheating on me.  I came home from work early today and find her in bed, fully naked and somewhat sweaty.  She insists she was just tired and hot, but I know the truth so I search the apartment.  I search and search, and I just can't find the guy who's been plowing her.  I give up and go out on my balcony for some air and to clear my head, and there the son of a bitch is, hanging from the bottom railing!  I was so angry I just started punching and kicking him, but he had some death grip or something; he just wouldn't let go.  I take off my shoe and I start beating his hands with it, and he eventually drops.  In my rage at my wife and at the horrible mess that is my life, I grabbed my refrigerator and hurled it over the balcony as well.  I then had a heart attack and died from the over exertion.

Saint Peter nods that this is indeed a horrible death, so the man is allowed to enter Heaven.

The second man:  I live on the 7th floor of an apartment building in Manhattan, and I was out on my balcony for some air and enjoying the view as I always do after work, but when I leaned against my railing it came loose and I fell.  I was able to grab on to the bottom railing of the balcony below mine, where I clung for dear life praying someone would come rescue me.  Eventually someone came, but to my dismay he started punching and kicking me.  I held on for as long as I could, but when he took off his shoe and started hitting my fingers I eventually fell.  Somehow I managed to land in some bushes and I was just stunned.  I started to get up but then a refrigerator fell on me and squashed me.

Saint Peter again agrees that this is horrible, so the man is allowed entry.

The third man:  Okay so picture this right?  I'm naked in a refrigerator..."

The pastor says, ""Well, as you may have heard, we take fasting pretty seriously here. And Lent is just around the corner. I'd like to ask you to do something that may seem strange, but it will really demonstrate that you're committed to this church and to our spiritual disciplines. I'd like you to give up all sexual contact with each other for the entire 40 days of Lent.""

The husband swallows hard. The wife audibly gasps. But they look at each other, and then to the pastor. The husband says, ""Okay. We'll give it a shot.""

A week into Lent, they show up at the pastor's office looking a bit shamefaced. The pastor welcomes them in, and they can't seem to make eye contact. He knows it's gone wrong and he folds his hands, leans forward and says, ""Tell me what happened.""

The young husband blurted out, ""We tried! We really tried. But the second day of Lent was our anniversary. We went out to dinner, had a bottle of wine, and when we got home, things just started to go, you know. Down a certain path."" The wife said, ""But nothing happened — we danced and kissed briefly and then I made him sleep on the couch.""

""The next night,"" the husband explained, ""We talked about it, and both felt pretty guilty. But as the evening wore on, I could tell that both of us were really wanting that physical intimacy. So I actually went to a friend's house and slept at his place.""

""Go on,"" said the pastor.

The husband said, ""And then yesterday evening, she was reaching up to grab a can of peas from the top shelf and, well, she just looked so beautiful — I mean, that's good, right? She's my wife! I'm supposed to find her arousing. She looked so good, I grabbed her, we kissed, and then we ripped off all of our clothes and had wild, passionate, loud, messy sex right there on the floor.""

The pastor stood up, shook his head in disgust and said with considerable exasperation as he motioned toward the door, ""I'm sorry. But you are no longer welcome here at this church.""

They got up to leave and the wife said, ""That's okay. We're not welcome at Kroger anymore either.""

The younger brother Mike is a real nice guy, but he's kind of a fuck-up.  Having been too busy to catch up for weeks, they decide to meet up at the local bar.

Dave says, ""Man, I'm sorry we haven't done this in a while.  I've been so stressed at work, and to top it off the sitter quits on me one week before I'm supposed to take the wife and kids to Europe.  I don't know how I'm going to arrange for someone to take care of the pets and look after mom with only a week's notice.""

Mike says, ""Hey, I'm not doing anything next week; let me take care of it for you!""  Dave replies, ""That's real nice of you, and don't take this the wrong way... but the last time I asked you to do a favor for me you killed my goldfish.  This is a little more serious than 7th Grade, Mike.""

Mike says, ""I know I've been a real fuck-up, but hear me out: I've turned over a new leaf.  I'm a different man now, Dave.  I have a steady job, a beautiful girlfriend... I only ever drink a little on the weekends.  Let me do you this favor to make up for all those years of being such a dope.""

Dave says, ""I really don't like to do this, but I'm in a bind... so against my better judgment, the wife and I would be very appreciative if you would take care of things while we're away.  Thanks for coming through for me Mike.""

When he lands in Europe, the first thing Dave does is pick up the phone and dial Mike to see how things are going.  Mike says, ""Hey, how ya doin?! ... Listen, I'm really sorry big brother, but the cat is dead.""

Dave says, ""WHAT?! JESUS CHRIST, I'M NOT EVEN GONE FOR A DAY AND YOU JUST KILLED THE FUCKING CAT! THE WIFE AND KIDS LOVE THAT CAT! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM?! You know the worst thing, Mike? You didn't even have the decency to let me enjoy my vacation for a single day. At the very least, lie to me, you piece of shit. Tell me the cat is on the roof.  Then the second day say, [bad, angry impression] 'HEY DAVE NOT MUCH GOING ON HERE, YEAH THE CAT'S STILL ON THE ROOF BUT TOMORROW I'M GOING TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT...' At least drag out my misery, you jackass.""

[Long, uncomfortable pause]

Mike says, ""Shit Dave, you're absolutely right.  I'm sorry.  I promise, I'm not going to let anything else interrupt the rest of your vacation.  I'll take care of everything and I bet I can even find a cat who looks just like snowball so you don't have to tell the girls anything.""

Dave says, ""I'm sorry for being so harsh on you little brother.  If you can get me out of this, all is forgiven.  By the way, how's mom doing?""

[Short pause]

Mike says, ""Uhhhh, I think mom is on the roof.""

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.
Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.
He made it out, but a single person died.
Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.
When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.
After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.
The man was perfectly fine.
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.
And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.
Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.
Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.
The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.
For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.
After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.
The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.
And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.
To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.
And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.
On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""
Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.
The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.
The executioner was speechless.
The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

67,OtherJokes,"Chinese torture A young man was wandering, lost, in a forest when he came upon a small house. Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost"""

66,OtherJokes,"Long ago, there was a cathedral... The old bell ringer had passed away and the bishop set out a sign announcing that the position was now open for new applicants.  A few weeks go by without  any bites, but one day a man comes in.  The man had a hunched back and no arms, so the bishop was leary of his ability to perform the job, but the Lord teaches love and acceptance of all.  He says to the man, ""if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours.""  

Elated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church's bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.

Weeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  Another replies...

""No, but his face sure rings a bell!""

With a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.

To ensure the new ringer's safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  And a voice replies...

""No, but he sure is a dead ringer for his brother!"""

The other guy nods hastily.

""Okay, then listen carefully! Wait until midnight, then go to the crossroad outside the village. Take the leftroad, walk about 5 minutes and then youll see a huge stone on the side of the road. On that stone will be sitting a huge toad. You will ask the toad: 

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?"".

The toad will respond: ""NO!"".

 And suddenly, your dick grows 4 inches!""

The man doesnt believe at first, but seeing as hes been mocked by women his entire life, he decides to give it a try.

He waits until midnight, goes to the crossroad, takes the left road, walks for 5 minutes and he sees a huge toad on a huge stone. He cant believe his eyes, but he maintains calm enough to ask: 

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?"" 

The toad responds: ""NO!""

The man hurries home, rushes into the bathroom, pulls down his pants and he cant believe what he sees - his dick is now 4 inches longer! He is mesmerized - yet not satisfied.

The next day, the man decides to try his luck again. He waits until midnight, goes to the crossroad, takes the left road, walks for 5 minutes and he sees the huge toad once again. And once again he asks:

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?""

And once again, the toad responds: ""NO!""

The man can already feel his dick grow up in the pants, and he is jumping with joy! 

""Just 4 more inches, and it will be just perfect!"", he thinks.

So the next day, he once again waits until midnight, goes to the crossroad, takes the left road, walks for 5 minutes and he sees the huge toad once again sitting on the huge stone. And once again he asks:

""Hello beautiful, would you like to have sex with me?""

And the toad responds:

""Are you fucking deaf?! No, no, no, no, and for the last time, NO!"""

I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.
Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

Upon entering, they realized that it was inhabited by cannibals, and tried to leave but were captured. They were brought before the cannibal king, and the king stated that they would survive and be able to leave if they could pass a test. The first part of the test was to go into the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.

The first man returned to the camp and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then told him the second part of the test, which was to shove the fruit up his ass, and if he made any expression, either verbal or physical, he would be eaten. The man tried, but winced before he could get one apple in, so he was killed.

The second man arrived back at the campsite and showed the king ten blueberries. ""What do you want me to do next?"" he asked. The king replied by telling him that he had to shove the berries inside him, and if he made any expression, he would be eaten. ""This'll be easy, they're just small berries, they can fit."" The man fit eight berries into his ass when he burst out laughing. Because he broke the rules of the king's test, he was eaten as well.

The first man and the second man met in heaven, and started talking about the king's test. The first one asked, ""Why did you laugh? You almost made it; you could've been able to leave."" The man replied, ""I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples."""

64,OtherJokes,"I mowed the lawn today.... ....and after doing so I sat down and had a cold beer. The day was really quite beautiful, and the drink facilitated some deep thinking.

My wife walked by and asked me what I was doing, and I said, ""nothing"". The reason I said ""nothing"" instead of saying ""just thinking"" is because she then would have asked, ""About what?"" At that point I would have had to explain that men are deep thinkers about various topics, which would lead to other questions.

Finally I pondered an age old question: Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts? Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts, but how could they know?

Well, after another beer, and some more heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with an answer to that question. Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby, and even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion. A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""

On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, ""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""

I rest my case. Time for another beer, and then maybe a nap."

63,OtherJokes,"An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets... An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets and bars of Soho one sunny afternoon.
 
Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window:
'Pianist wanted for evening performances'.
 
""Fucking get in there you cunt!"" he says to himself and goes to the bar.
""Get the fucking manager of this pigshit middle class wank pit please you cock sucking cunt"", he says to a somewhat startled barman.
The barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs.
""Can I help you sir?' he says.
""Yes you can you fucking fat assed piece of shit, I saw your shitty advert in the cunting window and I'm here to fucking audition. Wanker!""
 
The manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic.
 
At the end the thrilled barman cries,
""Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?""
""That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' ""
""Oh"" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, ""err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?""
""Fucking wanker..."" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears.
 
The manager, through his teardrops asks him the title.
""That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' ""
""I see"" says the manager. ""Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?""
""Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' "".
 
""Look,"" says the manager, ""I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience.""
 
""Fuck it"", says the pianist, ""why cunting not?""
On his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage.
 
During the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act.
 
After the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him.
""Hi"" she says.
""Oh, hello"" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.
She leans over and whispers in his ear,
""Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?""
Placing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says,
""Know it? I fucking wrote it!!"""

Ray the Chicken
 
Ray came home one night from a long day at work, slid into bed beside his sleeping wife, and fell into a deep slumber.
He awoke before the Pearly Gates, where St. Peter said, 'You died in your sleep, Ray.'

Ray was stunned. 'I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for. Send me back!'

St. Peter said, 'I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.'

Ray was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home. The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking and pecking the ground.

A rooster strolled past. 'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?'

'Not bad,' replied Ray the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!'

'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. 'Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?'

'Never,' said Ray.

'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal. He did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg! He was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg - his joy was overwhelming.

As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard.....

Little Carol stomped up the steps to her room and sat down to write God a letter.

Letter 1:

Dear God, 

I have been a very good girl this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one.

Your friend, Carol


Carol knew this wasn't true. She had not been a very good girl this year, so she tore up the letter and started over.


Letter 2: 

Dear God, 

This is your friend Carol. I have been a pretty good girl this year, and I would like a red bike for my birthday.

Thank You, Carol


Carol knew this wasn't true either. So she tore up the letter and started again.


Letter 3:

Dear God, 

I know I haven't been a good girl this year. I am very sorry. I will be a good girl if you just send me a red bike for my birthday.

Thank you, Carol


Carol knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get her a bike. By now, she was very upset. She went downstairs and told her mother she wanted to go to church. Carol's mother thought her plan had worked because Carol looked very sad.
""Just be home in time for dinner,"" her mother said... Carol walked down the street to the church and up to the altar. She looked around to see if anyone was there. She picked up a statue of the Virgin Mary, slipped it under her jacket and ran out of the church, down the street, into her house, and up to her room. She shut the door and sat down and wrote her letter to God...

Letter 4:


I GOT YOUR MAMA.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE.

One thing leads to another, and they find themselves telling political jokes. Concerns that any of the others may be KGB informants or that the room may be bugged are readily dissolved in alcohol. Everybody is having a great time.

One is tired and really feels like sleeping; he decides to pull a joke on the others. He excuses himself, runs to the lobby and gives the receptionist a few bills. “Please send someone to my room with a bottle of vodka, some rye bread and salt in ten minutes.” He then returns to the room.

After a few minutes, he notes to the others that stocks of refreshments are running low. “Not to worry, comrades! I have good contacts.”

He leans over towards the potted plant in the corner, grabs it and loudly says, as if speaking into a microphone:

“Comrades at the listening post, this is lieutenant Dyatlov! We urgently require a bottle of vodka, some rye bread and salt to our room! Make haste!”

The others laugh their asses off – until a minute later, there’s a knock on the door and vodka, salt and rye bread is served.

You could hear a pin drop. Our man goes to sleep, enjoying the quiet.

When he wakes up in the morning, the others are gone. A note is left on the table. “Comrade! A couple of your jokes yesterday would easily get you to Siberia! (The one about Stalin’s maid, while hysterical, could get you in front of a firing squad!!!) However, we liked that room service joke so much, we’ll let you off the hook this time. Sincerely, KGB.”"

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.  

Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.  

The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”
The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”  

The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”  

The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”  

The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.” The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”  

The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.  
The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.  

He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.  

So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.  

Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.” The man is relieved to no end.  

He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.  

But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk."

There is little evidence in support of the theory that ghosts exist but if they do there has certainly been no empirical support in favour of the idea that they take part in any major construction work.

are put on a deserted island [longish] For the purposes of this antijoke, let us suppose that the Hispanic man is not from Europe, but rather Latin America, so as not to be ignorantly redundant.  

They are told that they will be rescued in 24 hours, provided they have proved their survival skills. The Hispanic man is in charge of building a shelter, the European man is in charge of finding food, and the Asian man is in charge of finding supplies.

54,AntiJokes,"Eighty-eight days. Eighty-eight days. Eighty-eight days since sunlight. Eighty-eight days I've been trapped down here, in the dark. There's a metaphor in all of this, a twisted, black pearl that adorns my story, the Raven to my Poe, but eighty-eight days later, the poetic nature of the moment eludes me. I see nothing. I hear nothing. I feel nothing. Eighty-eight days of nothing.
I still remember that day, and in such precise detail. It's unnerving. If events had gone differently, if that fateful day had been just another day in the life, i doubt i'd remember every subtle contour of the painting that I glanced at, in that bustling cafe. The dull minty tingle of the tea i drank while sitting there at 8:04. The sweet aroma that filled the cafe that morning could have been just another detail, but somehow i remember it so vividly, so vividly that every morning it's that subtle smell that starts me from the darkness of my slumber to the darkness of my cell. Somedays I wake up wondering if i had this coming. Most days I wake up knowing I did.
I suppose identity is more than just power. Power can be assumed, usurped and gambled away, but identity is something so much more, something timeless. I've fought mine for so long now that I can't remember the last time I looked in a mirror and recognised the face staring me back, dead in the eyes. Windows to my soul? Hardly. Placards of my identity? Thats an altogether more terrifying idea. These eighty-eight days could be the final stretch of that battle. For all I know this is only the beginning.
Eighty-eight days I've been trapped here, and yet perhaps trapped is the wrong word. Can I really play the prisoner to my own warden?
I sealed my fate, and I now know that. Eighty-eight days ago, I did not. Eighty-eight days ago, my world was a brighter place. The lights are off now in my cell, and yet now, things are brighter than ever. ""Once I was blind, but now I see."" The truth is apparent, and I cling to that final triumph. Sanity slips away. Lights fade away. But Eighty-eight days later, I see what I've been missing. My cell walls fade away, and suddenly all is clear. The darkness is gone, and all is clear. I see all. I know all. All is clear. Eighty-eight days ago, my sister placed me in a shoe box, and in doing so, freed me. Vilification is the purest form of acceptance. The irony there escapes me. Breath escapes me. Life itself escapes me. I myself. Escape. Me.
Eighty-eight days ago, my sister placed me in a shoe box. Eighty-eight days later, I realise the truth.
I am a pair of nikes. All is still. Eighty eight days later, I am a pair of nikes. I  know that now. I cherish that now. I am a pair of nikes. I am a pair of nikes. The screen fades to black. I am a pair of nikes. The curtain falls. I am a pair of nikes. Children cry themselves to sleep, fathers walk out on families, wars break out, and the world breaks down. I am a pair of nikes.
I am a pair of nikes.

He remembers the looks on the boy's faces when they walked into that village and... oh Jesus. He shouldn't think about that now. Sometimes he still hears Tex's slow southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes. He always had a pack of Luckys. But the boys are gone now... he knows that. It's--it's just that he forgets sometimes. And sometimes the way that seven looks at him... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. And he feels like he's back there... In the jungle... In the darkness.

Seven has a hook for a hand as well, which is very scary."

""What's Logic?"" the first redneck asks.

The professor answers by saying, ""Let me give you an example. Do you own a weedeater?""

""I sure do.""

""Then I can assume, using logic, that you have a yard,"" replied the professor.

""That's real good!"" says the redneck.

The professor continues, ""Logic will also tell me that since you have a yard, you also own a house.""

Impressed, the redneck says, ""Amazin!""

""And since you own a house, logic dictates that you have a wife.""

""That's Betty Mae! This is incredible!""

The redneck is obviously catching on.

""Finally, since you have a wife, logically I can assume that you are heterosexual,"" said the professor.

""You're absolutely right! Why that's the most fascinatin' thing I ever heard! I cain't wait to take that logic class!!""

The redneck, proud of the new world opening up to him, walks back into the hallway, where his friend is still waiting. ""So what classes are ya takin'?"" asks the friend.

""What in tarnation is logic???"" asked his friend.

""Let me give you an example. Do ya own a weedeater?"" asked the first redneck.

54,AntiJokes,"Pink ping pong balls A day before his 15th birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' 

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. 

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died.

He sees the postman once a week and gets groceries once a month. Otherwise it's total peace and quiet.

After six months or so of almost total isolation, someone knocks on his door. He opens it and a huge, bearded man is standing there. 

'Name's Cliff, your neighbor from forty miles up the road. Having a Christmas party Friday night. Thought you might like to come at about 5:00...' 'Great', says Tom, 'after six months out here I'm ready to meet some local folks thank you.' 

As Cliff is leaving, he stops. 'Gotta warn you. Be some drinking'.'

The man rolls down his window and the cop steps out of his car. Already the cop is thinking to himself, what a low life, this man is covered in guts and he smells like trash. 

The cop steps outside the side of the window and asks the man, ""What do you even do for society?""

The man says in reply, ""Well sir, I'm an asshole stretcher.""

Seeing the cop looking baffled by the response, the man coninues to explain, ""I start with one finger, then two, three , four, then a fist, then two fists and eventually I can stretch an asshole out to about 6 feet.""

The cop still baffled replies, ""What in the hell do you do with a six foot asshole?""

The man replies, ""Stick him on the end of a bridge and give him a radar gun..."""

51,OtherJokes,"A man walks into a bar (semi-original) A man walks into a bar and sees a bunch of old men sitting around talking and drinking.  He gets up to the bar, and orders himself a drink, and casually listens into the conversations.

""Yes yes, but number 42.""  

""Number 42?  Two fifty eight.""  

""Are you kidding me?  Thirty three my friend.  Thirty three.""

The man looks at the bartender and asks, ""Hey what's with the numbers?""

""Oh they're just talking politics.  Same group, day in and day out.""

""But what's with the numbers?""

""Well, they got tired of re-hashing the same old arguments over and over.  So they just gave them a number.""

A man in back shouts, ""Fifty two, as always.""

Bartender says, ""See, fifty two means he's accusing the other guy of making an appeal to stone, which is a logical fallacy in which a statement is automatically dismissed as ridiculous without taking the evidence into consideration.""

""Wow, that's amazing.""

""Not really.  I've been listening to them for years.  Most of them don't even know what they're talking about.  I think you could just throw out random numbers and none of them would know it.""

Just then an elderly gentleman sits next to him.  The guy decides to give it a try, so he looks over and asks, ""So my friend.  Twenty eight.""

He replies, ""Twenty eight?  Bah!  A hundred and thirteen.""

""Fifty-two.""

""Fifty-two?"" The man raises his voice a little.  ""Seventy three!""

Not knowing what to say next, the man just spouts off random numbers.  ""Eight nine""

""Eight""

""Ninety six.""

""A hundred and four!""

The exchange continues back and forth.  Thirty-two.  Fifty Six.  Seventy nine.  One thirty three.  

The old man stops and with a huge grin, he says ""Ah ... very clever.  Very clever.  One thirty three.  But Sixteen.  You never considered sixteen. Checkmate.""

The guy, still clueless about what they just argued about, looks to the bartender, holds up his finger to motion for another drink and says, ""One.""

At that moment, the bar goes silent.  They all look to the man.  The elderly gentleman is furious.  Enraged.  He stands up, and with as strong a punch any octogenarian can muster, he hits the guy as hard as he can, and storms out.  

Stunned, the guy recomposes himself.  The bar goes back to their conversations, and he asks the bartender, ""What the hell just happened?""

""That was Saul Greenberg, and you just said he's no better than Hitler."""

The man goes and gets a violin and gives it to the octopus. Again, the octopus plays it amazingly, a virtuoso far beyond anything the man has seen before.

The man has to try one more time. He saw something that surely the octopus would be vexed by -  he grabs a set of bagpipes and brings it to the octopus. The octopus finally seems perplexed, just fiddling around with the bagpipes in confusion. Satisfied, the man says ""Ha! I knew you wouldn't be able to play it!""

The octopus looks at him and says ""Play it? I was gonna fuck it once I got the pajamas off of it."" "

51,AntiJokes,"A lonely and divorced man went to see a very pretty female urologist for his first prostate exam. He chose her because she came highly recommended by his family doctor and he was unaware of her prettiness until he first saw her. Despite the urologist's beauty and the fact that her lubricated and gloved finger was the first time that anything was put into this man's anus (he is on the prudish side of sexual activity and has swatted away a few attempts by girlfriends throughout his life to stimulate his prostrate while performing fellatio on him) he found that her utterly professional and calm demeanor put him at ease and he did not feel nearly the shame and humiliation that he was dreading once he realized that this beautiful woman would be the one examining him. The doctor was pleasantly surprised to find that the man's sphincter was relaxed and his prostate was easier than normal for her to examine. When they were done, and he rearranged his examination gown. The doctor noticed that he had an attractive face and athletic build and she found herself growing aroused. However, she wanted to respect the man's obvious discomfort and embarrassment, and so she retained her friendly, yet professional demeanor and refrained from doing anything that could possibly be construed as flirting. Like the patient, the doctor was also recently divorced, and when she went home that night she thought longingly of meeting a man with a face that was as kind and bashful face as his. When the man went home that night he thought of the beauty of this urologist and wondered if he would ever meet her in a social situation where he could see if his reasonably competent pick up game was strong enough to overcome the uncomfortableness of this exam and ask her out. However, none of this would matter, as the biopsy results of this exam would show that the man had stage 2 prostate cancer which would metastasize soon after and he'd spend the next six months undergoing chemotherapy and surgery to remove his prostate and these would be his last six months on earth as he would die alone 50 pounds lighter. His ex-wife would be the sole attendee of his funeral, she would not cry.

51,OtherJokes,"A rabbit needs to shit in the woods... ... but the animals have agreed in the sake of understandable issues not to crap all over the place where they live. And let me tell you they also appointed the local police-bear to watch out for any rule-breakers. 

Still, the rabbit is feeling a very hard urge to let go a few of his brown droplets in a secluded area. He knew that the fox did it and the bear didn't catch him so he had it going for him. Alas, the police-bear happened to be in the vicinity of the crime. He didn't see it happening but let me tell you he had a nose for these kind of things, he even caught a pair of birds shitting off of a tree branch.

Now, the police-bear approaches the rabbit *""Did you shit in the woods, rabbit?""*

The rabbit quickly covers his misdoing with his hat. *""No, sir, but as others might say, does the bear shit in the wood""*

Rather angrily and not amused the police-bear answers *""Don't play smartass with me, I saw you covering your shit with your hat""*

*""But sir I mean it, I have not shat here. You see I was catching a butterfly, that's what I covered with my hat""*

*""Then lift your hat""*

*""No can do, it will fly away""*

The police-bear thinks, this rabbit won't outfox him like the fox did earlier. He readies his pistol and shoots a couple of rounds at the hat. ""Now it won't fly away, lift your hat""

*""Aye, sir""* and the rabbit slowly raises the hat, and as the police bear sees the shit beneath, the rabbit exclaims in a high pitched voice:

*""**Fuck, bear, you shot the living crap out of it!**""*"

I was so angry that when I found the guy hanging outside the window I threw things at him until he fell. However, he only broke his legs, and I wasn't satisfied, so instead I grabbed the fridge and pushed it out onto him. But in doing this, I had a heart attack, and here I am.""

""Oh boy."" Replied Saint Peter ""Well, while I'm sad that your wife was not true, it is wrong to kill. I'm afraid you have to go to hell."" With that, the husband is ushered off to hell.

I screwed up enough courage to smile at her and say hello. Apparently that was enough for her to take interest, and even though I wasn't that into her once the initial novelty wore off, we spent the next few months dating.

3 months later, it turns out that she's a virgin, and we still have not sealed the deal. This was fine with me, I was patient and respected her choices. At the end of one particularly memorable date, I pulled up in front of her house to drop her off and she leans over and kisses me before getting out of the car. I decided to go for broke and grabbed the back of her head, continuing the kiss a lot longer than usual. Things began to get hot and heavy and I could tell she was into it, but she was also incredibly nervous.

""I'm sorry Ender, I have to go, my grandmother's waiting for me inside.""

""That's cool, can I meet her?""

""Ummmm, sure, I guess....""

So we go inside and introductions are made. We chat for a while and grandma tells me stories, like what Christmas was like in the 40's. I make Grandma laugh several times and she ends up adoring me, as most Grandmas do.

Finally it was time to go. I said goodnight, and it was then that she smiled at me, winked, and nodded her head towards the stairs. I was totally expecting to just head home as usual, but it looked like my charm lit a fire in her and the situation was about to change for the better!

We eventually make it up to her room, and while she was incredibly nervous, I finally got her completely naked and things really started getting wild at that point. I never expected it, but she was a complete animal! That night may have been the best sex of my life.

At one point she stops me and says ""Maybe we should take a break.""

""Why, is everything ok? Did I hurt you?""

""No it's not that, it's just that I think I hear my granddaughter crying downstairs, and I really don't want to deal with that again tonight."""

""I'm lost,"" said the young man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" ""OK,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old, and entered the house. 

During dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. During the night, he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet, so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes, he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought.""If that's the best the old man can do, then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window, and threw the boulder out. 

As he did so, he noticed another note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. 

As he plummeted towards the ground, he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bed post."""

did was eat, sleep, and play fetch. 
want a pet that can do everything!""

44,OtherJokes,"Joke my 63 year old British dad just told me... Two American astronauts zoom off to the moon, they land on the moon safely and hop out of the module. They do some routine work, collecting rock samples, checking temperatures and the like.

Then one of them sees a man in the distance sitting on a deck chair wearing a handkerchief with knots on each corner on his head licking an ice cream. He turns to the other astronaut and says ""Who the hell is that!"". So they go over and one of the astronauts asks ""Who are you!?"" to which the man replied ""Can't you see? I'm God!"". 

""Well God, what are you doing here in such a desolate place like the moon?"" said one of the astronauts.

""I'm on holiday! Can't you tell?"" replies God.

""Well why the moon?"" said the astronaut.

""Well it's like this, last year I went to Mars: All these funny little green men running about all over the place, I didn't like it. The year before that I went Venus: Far too hot."" Says god.

Now this astronaut had an idea, he thought "" If I can get him to come back to Earth with us I might be able make some money out of this, play it of as the second coming off Jesus!""

So the astronaut asks God ""Why don't you come to Earth, it's much nicer down here there's warm blue sea's and blue skies and long golden beaches - a beautiful planet! I can give you a lift!""

To this god tells them ""Earth! Don't talk to me about that place! I went there over 2000 years ago, got some woman in the pudding club and they're STILL talking about it now!""

43,OtherJokes,"Cinderella was now 95 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now-dead prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a dog named Bob for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the fairy godmother. Cinderella said, ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?""

The fairy godmother replied, ""Cinderella, you have lived an exemplary life since I last saw you. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?""

Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed, and after some thoughtful consideration, she uttered her first wish: ""The prince was wonderful, but not much of an investor. I'm living hand to mouth on my disability checks, and I wish I were wealthy beyond comprehension.""

Instantly her rocking chair turned into solid gold.

Cinderella said, ""Ooh, thank you, Fairy Godmother!""

The fairy godmother replied, ""It is the least that I can do. What do you want for your second wish?""

Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, ""I wish I were young and full of the beauty and youth I once had.""

At once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned - and Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years.

Then the fairy godmother spoke once more: ""You have one more wish; what shall it be?""

Cinderella looked over to the frightened dog in the corner and said, ""I wish for you to transform Bob, my old dog, into a kind and handsome young man.""

Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so beautiful the likes of him neither she nor the world had ever seen.

The fairy godmother said, ""Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new life."" With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone as suddenly as she appeared.

For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect man she had ever seen.

Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young, muscular arms. He leaned in close, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered....

42,OtherJokes,"DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN Names
===========
If Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice go out for lunch, they will call each other Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice.
If Fred, Luke, Bradley, and Jeff go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bruno, Scrappy, Peanut-Head and Godzilla.

Eating Out
===========
When the bill arrives, Fred, Luke, Bradley, and Jeff will each throw in $20, even though the total is only $34.25. None of them will have any smaller bills and none will admit they want change back.
When Linda, Kate, Paula and Janice get their bill, out come the 
pocket calculators.

Money
===========
A man will pay $10 for a $5 item he needs.
A woman will pay $5 for a $10 item that she doesn’t need, because it’s on sale.

Bathrooms
===========
A man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, razor, shaving cream, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Motel 6.
The average number of items in a woman’s bathroom is 284. The average man would not be able to identify most of them.

Arguments
===========
Women always have the last word in an argument.
Anything a man adds after that is the beginning of a new argument.

Cats
===========
Women love cats.
Men may say they love cats, but when women are not looking, will men kick cats.

The Future
===========
A woman worries about the future — until she gets a husband.
A man never worries about the future — until he gets a wife.

Success
===========
A successful man is one who makes more money than can be spent by his wife.
A successful woman is one who can find that a man.

Marriage
===========
A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn’t.
A man marries a woman expecting that she won’t change, and she does.

Dressing Up
===========
A woman will dress up when she goes shopping, empties the garbage, answers the phone, waters the plants, gets the mail and reads a book.
A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.

Natural
===========
Men wake up looking as good as when they went to bed.
Women will somehow deteriorate during the night.

Children
===========
A woman knows all about her children. She knows about their best friends, romances, secret hopes and dreams, favorite foods, fears and dental appointments.
A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.

Maturity
===========
Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can function as adults. Most 17-year old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.

Handwriting
===========
To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken-scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their “i’s” with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their “p’s” and “g’s”. It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she’s dumping you, she’ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.

Groceries
===========
A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett’s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 12-items-or-less lane.

Going Out
===========
When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she WILL be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earrings and finishes putting on her makeup.

Low Blows
===========
Let’s say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says, “Oh, gee. That must have hurt.” The man groans and doubles over, and actually FEELS the pain.

Laundry
===========
Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat.

The Wedding
===========
When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about “the ceremony”. Men talk about “the bachelor party”."

42,OtherJokes,"We had our first child and he's beautiful, but he had a rare birth defect. He was born without eyelids. We had to keep his eyes irrigated and shielded from light while they searched for a pediatric plastic surgeon who could correct it.

Fortunately one of the top surgeons in our region was available. When our attending physician explained the situation to him, he asked, ""Has the patient been circumcised yet?"" Our doc replied that he hadn't, and the surgeon explained his plan.

The NICU cut a short length of 5mm silicone tubing and placed it over the tip of our newborn's penis, then carefully stretched his little foreskin over the end of the tubing and taped it in place. After 12 hours they replaced it with 7.5mm tubing, then after 24 hours they replaced that with 10mm tubing.

The next day the surgeon arrived. They wheeled our baby into surgery where he performed the circumcision and then immediately used the recovered, stretched tissue to replace the missing eyelids.

Afterward, the surgeon explained to us that he's done this surgery only three times before but it was always successful, and since it used the baby's own tissue there was virtually no chance of rejection.

We thanked the surgeon and asked if there were any side effects we should look out for.

""Well,"" he said thoughtfully, ""he'll probably be a little cockeyed.""

Suddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. 

Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone. 

Bob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. 

A minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, ""Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We've been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone??"" 

""I'm sorry,"" replied the hunchback, ""but we don't have a phone. My master is a Doctor; come in and I will get him!"" 

Bob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. ""I'm afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory."" 

With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. 

After a brief examination, Igor's master looks worried. ""Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion."" Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. 

The Hills' deaths upset Igor's master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house. 

Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! 

Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master:

Tonight, I thought my husband was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. 

I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment on it.

Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much.

I asked him what was wrong; He said, ""nothing."" 

I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. 

He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.

On the way home, I told him that I loved him. 

He smiled slightly, and kept driving.  I can't explain his behavior. 
I don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.'

When we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and absent.

Finally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep; I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.

35,OtherJokes,"How the Internet Started, According to the Bible In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a healthy young wife by the name of Dorothy.   And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg.  Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.
 
And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?""
 
And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, dear?""
 
And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).""
 
Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums.  And the drums rang out and were an immediate success.  Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.
 
To prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew.  It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP).
 
And the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.  They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS.  And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks.
 
And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known.  He said, ""We need a name that reflects what we are.""
 
And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.""  ""YAHOO,"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.
 
Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside.
 
It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE).
 
That is how it all began. And that's the truth."

35,OtherJokes,"Champ, the much-loved pub mascot. Ted was the landlord of the Nag's Head pub. Every night, the same guys would turn up, have a few pints of beer, share a conversation and the occasional game of darts or dominoes. At 8pm every night, Ted would receive a visit from one of his other regulars - Champ, a stray dog who always came for a bowl of water and a few bags of pork scratchings. The regulars all loved Champ, and he was treated like the pub's mascot. 

One night just before 8pm, there was a screech of brakes outside the pub, shortly followed by a man running into the pub in a state of distress. 

""This dog, it just ran out in front of my car...I think I've killed it!""

Ted immediately feared the worst, and sure enough when he went outside, it was the heavily mangled remains of Champ in the middle of the road. Only Champ's tail remained intact. 

Ted and the other regulars were in shock, but soon decided that they should have some kind of tribute to such a well-loved regular of the pub. 

""Why don't we get his tail stuffed, and hang it above the bar?"" suggested one of the regulars. This was thought to be a great idea, and shortly after a taxidermist was called and Champ's tail was stuffed.

On New Year's Eve that year, Ted was having a quiet drink after having closed the bar at the end of a successful evening. All of a sudden, he heard some scratching noises coming from the front door. ""That sounds like Champ!"" thought Ted, but one glance at the tail above the bar told him it couldn't be. He looked into his drink, shook his head and carried on drinking. 

10 minutes later, he heard the same scratching noises. This time, he couldn't shake off his curiosity and made his way to the front door. When he opened the door, he recoiled with a huge fright; there in front of him was the ghost of Champ on the door step, looking up at him. 

+I'd like my tail back, please+ came this voice inside his head.

""I...I...I can't d-d-d-do that!"" stuttered Ted. 

+I'd like my tail back, please+ repeated the ghostly form of Champ. 

""I can't do that"" replied Ted, having overcome his original shock. 

+I have come seeking the return of my tail. I cannot transition through to the afterlife in such an incomplete state. Why can I not have my tail back?+ insisted Champ. 

Ted glanced at the clock. It was now 3:30am. 

""I'm sorry, but we can't retail spirits at this time of night."""

34,OtherJokes,"Three devotees decide to prove the power of their faith... ...they all decide to jump off a cliff one by one, all the while invoking the name of their chosen deity.

The first devotee, a Buddhist, proceeds to stand at the edge of the cliff and begins reciting the mora sutta. At the end of the chant he jumps and calls on Buddha three times: ***""Buddha protect your servant, Buddha protect your servant, BUDDHA PROTECT YOUR SERVANT!""*** 

Lo and behold, just before he hits the ground he turns into a mighty eagle and swoops away and alights once again on the top of the cliff as a man.

The remaining devotees are amazed and agrees that Buddha is a worthy deity, but that their deities will not be bested.

The second devotee, a Roman Catholic, steps up to the cliff edge and stands quietly for a few moments. He then proceeds to jump and shouts: ***""Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I SHALL FEAR NO EVIL!""***

Halfway down the cliff face, a shaft of light envelops the Catholic and he is borne aloft on the arms of a host of angels and is safely deposited at the top of the cliff.


The other devotees are again amazed and agrees the Lord really is a deity worthy of all praise.


The third devotee, a Muslim, then proceeds to the edge of the cliff; he kneels down and begins his own prayers. He does so for several minutes and then stands up and turns and walks away from the edge. 


The Buddhist and the Catholic are confused and immediately question the Muslim's faith in Allah.


The Muslim just smiles and tells them, ***""Allah spoke to me and bade me tell you that you are both very much welcome and that he strongly counsels against such silly acts as jumping off a cliff.""***"

31,OtherJokes,"An inspiring true story about my friend's grandmother. I'd like to tell you a little-known, but inspiring and true story that involves my friend Jake's grandmother.

Her name was Erica. She lived a typical grandmother life, knitting, spoiling her grandchildren and puttering around.

But despite having lived a full life before retiring, she wanted something more. So she decided to take her love of gin and turn it into a hobby. Erica painstakingly researched different recipes for gin, mixed them with her cooking expertise, and experimented for months with different ratios, strainers and ingredients.

After many months of working on her various gins, one of her friends, Stacy, came over to her house one night and happened to try one of the drinks. Stacy found it so delicious that she suggested that Erica should try selling some of her various flavors of gin. Erica did just that, starting at the local farmer's market, and when her popularity increased, she began mass producing her most-loved flavors of gin.

Erica's gin quickly became hailed as one of the best-grade gins in the world, earning awards and feature articles in popular publications.

It wouldn't last though. Erica's life was tragically cut short by a heart attack, and with her death came the death of her secret recipes. Many people would try to recreate Erica's gin for years to come, yet no one could find the proper mixtures of ingredients.

But Stacy, the one who pushed her to start her business, never gave up. She searched and searched, looking through purchase logs and transactions for the suppliers of Erica's juniper berries, malt, and other ingredients. Stacy worked nights and weekends for months on end, ardently refining her product, until, amazingly, she came across the perfect recipe. Erica's original gin recipe. It tasted exactly like the first gin Erica had made that fateful night years before. Stacy brought the original Erica brand of gin back to the world, and gin-lovers the world over rejoiced at her work.

The moral of this story is thus: With hard work and perseverance, you too can Make An erica Grade-A gin."

'Ladies and gentlemen! Unfortunately, we'll crash... unless we get rid of some extra weight. The stewardesses have already thrown out all unnecessary objects, but this wasn't enough, so a few passangers will have to sacrifice themselves as well. Are there any volunteers?'

Dead silence.

'Then, we'll have to choose based on a certain quality,' continues the pilot. 'Of course, we'd like to avoid any semblance of racism, so we'll go in alphabetical order. Please, all African-Americans stand!'

Nobody stands up.

'Then I'd like to ask the black- and brown-skinned passangers to stand up!'

At this point, a black boy whispers something to his father:

30,OtherJokes,"A girl in my class was a total attention whore A girl I knew in class was a total attention whore.

Never arrived to class on time and always made sure to make a huge fuss about it.

Didn't talk to her all that much, but I had a few conversations with her.
 
Her wrists had cuts and burns all over them. She wore t-shirts so she never hid them.

I asked her why she would hurt herself like that. 

She said ""No one loves me and my life is painful"" etc., etc.

""No one loves you? What about your parents or your boyfriend?""

Answer she gave me was something like ""They actually don't love me,"" or some shit like that. 

Made a point to not interact with her too much after that, because she's too much of an attention whore. 

End of the school year, she came up to me and asked if I wanted to go somewhere with her that Sunday. 

I'm not good with these situations, so I couldn't say no, even though I didn't like her.

Sunday came, and we went to one of those tower car parks. 

Just as we got to the top, she told me that she wanted me to be here as a witness for her suicide. 

""Oh shit,"" I thought. She was going to jump and was forcing me to watch! 

Had I known that she was going to do this, I wouldn't have gone with her. 

""Not watching unless you do a flip."" I said that to try and shock her into realizing this was stupid. 

Complete shock was written all over her face. She thought I'd try and stop her.

 ""E-eh? You're not going to stop me?"" 

""No, go on ahead. If you really wanted to live, you'd stop yourself."" 

After a while, she got off the ledge. She walked up to me afterwards and tried to hug me with tears in her eyes, but I told her I loved someone else. She asked me who, and I told her to read the first letter of *every line.﻿*"

29,OtherJokes,"Some advice I do want to apologize in advance if this is in the wrong section of Reddit, but I really felt I needed to get it off my chest. But anyways, as a teacher, let me tell you a little story...

I had a female student (I'm a male), who was rather attractive. Not gonna lie. But I would never pursue a student sexually or romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.

She wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.

So a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. 

The father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, ""And what did you even expect would come of something like this?"" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: ""About tree fiddy."" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, ""Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!""

TL;DR Teenage girls are crazy"

28,OtherJokes,"A gorilla that swung too far A zoo was barely making ends meet. The head zookeeper was keeping things together, but it was a struggle. Instead of a pride of lions, they had one lone lion. Instead of a band of gorillas, just two. The rest of the zoo animals were just as sparse.

One day during a thunder and lightning storm, a single bolt of lightning struck the two remaining gorillas and killed them both instantly. Thankfully due to the storm, there were no people visiting the zoo and so the general public wasnt aware of the tragedy. The head zookeeper pulled a staff member aside and said ""Hey, I've got a gorilla suit in the back. Why dont you put it on every day, get in the habitat and act like a gorilla and I'll see that you get paid an extra $50 a day.""

The staff member agreed, and everything seemed to be working out fine. The public thought it was an authentic gorilla, the staff member made an extra $50 a day and the zoo didnt have to go through the trouble of finding a new gorilla plus deal with the financial hassle of maintaining a real animal.

The staff member realized one day that he could swing on the artificial vines on the tree in the habitat. He got quite good at it, and would at times swing out so far that he would leave the gorilla enclosure. The head zookeeper didnt care because he knew the gorilla was really a man in a gorilla suit, so he let it continue. The public loved it, thinking that a real gorilla was actually getting out of the enclosure, it heightened their sense of enjoyment.

One fateful day, when the staff member gave a particularly vigorous swing, his momentum carried him quite far out of the range of the gorilla enclosure. In fact, he realized he was directly over the lion habitat. At that moment, the artifical vine snapped, and he tumbled down through the air. He landed flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him.

The lone lion saw the gorilla fall, and sprang over with a roar. The man in the gorilla suit was terrified, and as his breath returned to him, he began to yell for help. ""SAVE ME!!! I'M NOT A REAL GORILLA!!!"" he yelled. At that moment, the lion moved his jaws towards the monkey head, opened his mouth and said...

""Shut up you idiot, or we will both lose our jobs!"""

28,OtherJokes,"The Tramps Holiday There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and Mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

.' '.

through the asteroid belt,

past Mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

I'm a just poor tramp...

so you must understand...

I've been through many a hard ship in my life.""

""Of course!"" said the monk. ""We have a room just for tourists like you, we can even offer you some food in the morning. However, I must warn you. You may wake up in the middle of the night hearing a strange sound.""

""What strange sound?"" the man asked monk, now very curious as to what this might be about.

""I wish I could tell you"", said the monk. ""But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.""

Although bummed out, the man didn't think much of it. I mean, he got what he wanted. A place to spend the night, and that's all you can ask for. But when he awoke in the middle of the night to the strangest sound he had ever heard in his entire life his curiosity creeped back to him. He NEEDED to know what this unearthly sound was. So when the monk came with his food in the morning he asked him again. 

""I'm sorry"", said the monk. ""But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.""

""Ok, then I want to become a monk"", said the man.

""Becoming a monk is not easy, it requires much dedication and many can't do it.""

""I'll do whatever it takes, like, absolutely anything. I NEED to know the source of this sound.""

""Very well"", the old monk seemed pleased with the answer. ""To become a monk, you must travel the world and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Once you do that, you become a monk.""

The man walked out of the temple. His journey had now begun. He started traveling all across the world. Counting every blade of grass and every grain of sand. 
Many, many years later he returned to the temple. The old monk were, to his surprise, still alive, waiting for him on the top of the stairs to the temple. 

""So?""

""I counted it to 56738370921 blades of grass, and 27489173408820 grains of sand!"" the man said with triumph on his face.

""I can see your dedication. Congratulations, you are now a monk.""

""So... I get to see the source of the sound?""

""Yes, you may. Follow me please.""

So he followed the old monk. Through the temple and into a tiny room at the back. The only thing housed in this room was a large wooden door.

""Behind here, is the source of the sound"", said the monk.

""FINALLY!"" the man thought to himself. ""I FINALLY get to see the source of the sound.""
He walked up to the large wooden door, filled with anticipation. He placed his hand on the handle and slowly opened the door. 


And what was behind the door? I would tell you, but only monks are allowed to know the source of the sound."

He got out of his car and looked around.  In the distance, he saw a pink-striped house.

He walked to the house, went up a pink-striped sidewalk, knocked on a pink-striped door, and was greeted by a pink-striped man who asked, ""How can I help you?""

To this, the pink-striped man replied, ""I'm sorry, the phone is down right now, but you can stay the night and call a tow truck in the morning.""

27,OtherJokes,"An Elephant Never Forgets In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Northwestern University .

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

I guess it wasn't the same elephant."

“Oh that's easy, you see...” Taking a big sip of his beer, with his eyes now firmly on the backside of a nearby stunner, he continues, conversationally. “I'm a rapist.”

26,OtherJokes,"The camping story A couple of years ago I went out camping in the woods with a few of my friends. It was a dark and stormy night, and we felt very alone in our little tent, so we started telling scary stories.

I described how the hills we were in used to be coal mining country, and the coal mines were dark and dangerous. If you didn’t die from coal lung you’d die from cave-ins, and if you didn’t die from either of those, you’d starve to death on the miniscule wages they paid you. The mine just up the hill from us was the worst. The manager had an extortion racket that he was keeping hidden from the owners - he would demand a “tribute” of 50% of the day’s wages from each of his miners, or he would think up a reason to get them fired. Pay was starvation level even without giving the manager his cut, and so after a few months of this tribute the miners became pale, sickly, and emaciated. Paradoxically, they started working harder and harder, hoping they would strike it rich enough to get a bonus that they could use to get out of that awful place.

One of the miners worked even harder than the others. He just kept digging and digging, and when he looked back, he’d gone too far, left everyone else behind, and couldn’t find his way back. Life out there was so bad he found he barely cared. He just kept digging and digging and digging, figuring that working himself to death was as good a way to go as any other.

Finally he came to a vein of rock darker than any he’d ever seen before, and when he broke through it - wham! - he had dug all the way to Hell. Satan came over to meet him, and told the miner that they had a problem. He couldn’t stay in Hell, because he wasn’t a sinner. But he couldn’t go back either, because the rules say no mortal may leave Hell alive. So Satan offered him a deal - he would transform the man into a vengeful ghost, who could spend eternity possessing mortals and driving them to madness.

The miner thought a bit, but he wasn’t convinced. The only guy he wanted to possess and drive to madness was his evil manager who had stolen a tribute from every one of his paychecks. After getting revenge on him, he wasn’t sure he wanted an eternity of possessing random other people. Satan suggested that maybe he could spend eternity possessing people and talking about how evil his manager was, so as to make his name forever dishonored. The man thought that was a good idea, and so with a word Satan transformed him into a spirit. He spent a while haunting his evil manager, then after that possessed random other people in the area to give monologues on how exploitative his manager’s labor practices were.

And so, I finished, sometimes, on nights much like tonight, with groups of campers much like our own…

“Hold on,” interrupted my friend. “Is this going to end with you saying that you’re possessed right now, and that’s why you’re telling us this story?”

“Um,” I said…“I guess that…”

Just then the police burst into our tent. “Stop right there!” said one of the officers. “You’re under arrest!”

“For what?” I asked.

“Possession by a miner within tent to diss tribute.”"

CLASSIC VERSION: 

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 

Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. 

MODERN VERSION: 

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 

Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. 

CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? 

Then a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with ""green bias,"" and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. 

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings ""It's Not Easy Being Green."" Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the ""Temperatures of the 80's.""

Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share."" Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act"" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. 

Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. 

The ant loses the case. 

The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. 

The ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of ""fairness"" has dawned in America. "

Adam watched for 9 days as this continued until the ocean was bluer than it had been when it was originally created. When Adam saw that God was finished, he came out of hiding and immediately tried to butter God up and get back in his good graces.

""Man, the water is spectacular. You did an amazing job! It looks better than it did when you first created it."" ""Thank you"" the Lord responded, ""It was no easy task. It took far less effort to create it than it did to fix it."" Adam continued to Praise the work that had been done... ""This is the most magnificent sight I've ever laid my eyes upon!

21,OtherJokes,"A monster in london By the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London.

London of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216.

The first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide.

By the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames… no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source.

He, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil’s Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster’s hunger exceeded even this atrocity.

On August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast.

London in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars… warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights.

The battle was truly a footnote to his preparation… Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose.

Honorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving.

The beast broke the surface.

No human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus’ left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle.

The monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster’s eye.

Angered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster’s mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now.

Once he had braced himself inside the beast’s mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust.

When his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus’ “luck” in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus’ blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water’s rush against the beast’s exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, “August 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?”

Two weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared.

The body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus.

Honorus’ solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage.

A bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London’s trade after the Hiatus of the Beast.

Still, Honorus has one final contribution to this history… It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus’ injuries.

After the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought.

One week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus’ foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold.

In the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus’ sausages. And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing’s most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor:… It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames…"

He goes out into the woods looking for something to shoot at when he comes to a clearing and sees on the other side a bear!  Imagining a helluva hunting story, he takes aim, shoots until he's out of bullets, and then runs across the clearing to claim his prize. He looks around behind the bushes and doesn't see anything. Then he feels a tap on his shoulder. 

He spins around and there's the bear! The bear says, ""Look, buddy, I don't really appreciate being shot at. But I can see that you're new at this whole hunting thing so I'm going to give you a choice. You can let me maul you... Or you can let me fuck you in the ass.""  The guy thinks it over and decides he can always come back and kill the bear tomorrow, so he agrees to option 2. The bear does his thing and the guy goes home. 

The next morning, the guy wakes up, sore as hell and pissed off. He limps to the pawn shop and buys himself a hunting rifle. He heads back out into the woods and soon finds himself at the same clearing. Sure enough, there's the bear on the other side. Again, he shoots every bullet he has and then runs over to make sure he got the bear this time. But once again, he feels a tap on his shoulder and behind him is the bear, looking pretty pissed off himself. ""Ok asshole, same deal,"" says the bear. Figuring he'll get the bear tomorrow for sure, the guy agrees to be ass-raped again. So the bear does his thing, and the guy goes home. 

The next day, the guy is fucking determined. He hobbles back to the pawn shop and buys a whole case of grenades. He heads back to the woods and just starts tossing them everywhere. After the smoke clears, he goes back to where the clearing used to be, hoping to find some charred fur or bear chunks to prove he's killed the bear this time.  But he feels a tap on his shoulder *again* and the bear says, ""son, you aren't in this for the hunting, are you?"""

21,OtherJokes,"Paul has a shitty life... Paul has a shitty life, his wife constantly berates him, his job sucks, his boss is a bully, his car is a shitty 85 ford pinto with a cracked windshield and is in bad need of a new transmission and to top it all off he's chubby, balding, and he has a small penis. 

The only thing good in Paul's life is his friend Artie.  Artie isn't the brightest bulb in the world, but he's always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade.  Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship.  Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul's best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend.

Artie's life wasn't much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job.  In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie's car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn't end up with Paul's shitty wife.

For Paul's 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages (46, 45).  Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers.  

On Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t.v. to read out the numbers.  Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them.  The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05.  Both of Paul and Artie's hearts start beating, thats 200$ already.  53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46....... Paul feints.  He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars.  

Two minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul's place.

Halfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain't gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul's Wife has got to go.

Artie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul's wife anyway.  But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and ""Pays"" Artie to off his wife.  And they come up with a plan.

40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul's front door only to find Paul's wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling ""WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!"" ""WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK?""...... on and on she yells until finishes with ""WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE!"" and slams the door to the bedroom.  They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches.  

The next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul's wife in the morning.  Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with ""yes, dear"", ""Of course, Dear"", ""I'll get right on it Dear."" All the while feeling like crap.  That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie ""It's a go"".

While Paul's wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul's wife's Car and waits for her.  When paul's wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death.  At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour.  

Little does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape.

Artie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well.  Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him.

The next day the paper lands on Paul's doorstep with the headline ""Artie Chokes two for a dollar at Safeway""

The man takes another drink, and spits it back out again. 

""That's closer,"" the man says, ""but it's not the twelve year old whiskey that I wanted.""

The bartender is stunned. He apologises once more and realises that this man can taste the difference, so there's no fooling him. At last, the bartender gives in, opens up the expensive 12 year old whiskey, and pours a glass.

In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his 30s and 40s, it’s like a birch, flexible but reliable. After his 50s, it’s like a Christmas tree.” “A Christmas tree?” the daughter asks. “Yes, dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.”"

20,OtherJokes,"the pink gorilla Here it is, the one that started r/feghoot.

So a man is on a business trip through Romania. He had missed the train and so had to take his car instead. His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time.

So he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone's gps to find an alternate route.

He exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on.

As he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong.

He got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station.

He coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead.

So having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone.

He continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it's worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward.

A bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn't the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open.

He decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house.

The man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door.

""can I help you?"" asks the butler

""yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don't have cell signal and...""

""follow me."" said the butler, sternly cutting him off.

He follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy.

The butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning.

""what did they say?"" asked the butler.

""they can't send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb...""

""Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms."" says the butler cutting him off again.

He follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms.

""geez,"" says the man, chuckling to himself, ""do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?""

The butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom.

""we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something.""

The butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob.

In the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner.

""you must never touch the pink gorilla!"" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace.

The butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked.

Not sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It's not like he would have found the cage by accident.

He eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn't decide if what he saw was real or not.

So he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn't want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi...

SHHHOOOK BAM!

He froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.

The door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.

The gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace.

He frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn't sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail.

Just as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn't open for him. So he began to climb.

He got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla's cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate.

Running as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won't start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.

The gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man's cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says,

""you're it."""

After the meal, and the check was delivered, the waitress noticed the man pulled out his wallet and dumped the exact amount of the bill onto the table plus a generous whole number tip. She was surprised but grateful so didn't mention anything.

The third night the man came in with his ostrich once more, ordered an appetizer, some more drinks, and two more entrees different than before.

She also takes a liking to a particularly foul-mouthed and ill-tempered parrot (this shop has a lot of them). She takes the parrot home, thinking it will be a fun project to clean up his act.

At home, she tries to teach the parrot how to say ""You look nice this evening."" However, the parrot will only say, ""You look like shit!""

She tries to teach the parrot how to say ""Please feed me."" However, he will only say, ""Yo, gimme some fucking food, bitch!""

She tries for days to change the parrot's habits, but he is still as foul-mouthed and rude as ever. The woman's patience is growing thin, and she begins to feel that she made a terrible mistake buying such a mean pet.

Finally, one day, after an hour of trying to teach the parrot to say something nice, the parrot says, ""Shut the fuck up already, you old ugly hag!"" The woman is fed up, screams, and in her frustration, opens the freezer door and stuffs the parrot inside.

The parrot begins squawking loudly and furiously, beating his wings and making an enormous racket from inside the freezer. After about ten seconds, the noise stops. Fearing the worst, the woman immediately feels a wave of remorse and shame wash over her. She throws open the freezer door, and is relieved to see the parrot is alive and well.

He calmly steps out of the freezer, hops onto the counter, and says, ""Thank you so much for letting me out. I very much appreciate it.""

The woman is stunned, but says, ""You're welcome.""

The parrot continues, ""I'm sorry about my earlier behavior. If there's ever anything you need, I am at your service.""

The woman has no idea what to make of this, but thanks the parrot all the same. There is an awkward silence.

19,OtherJokes,"A cowboy walks into a deserted saloon... And there's no tinkling waltz on the piano, no gentle buzzing about the days activities, it's empty. A mournful bartender polishes an immaculate glass and halfheartedly waves away a fat, clueless fly.

The cowboy sidled into a stool and fished a coin out of his pocket. He flicked it with his thumb, and it sang in the air before ringing out on the wooden bar.

""Say friend, you got a whiskey?""

The coin rattles to a stop, and the bartender looks up with a patient smile.

""That is,"" says the cowboy, ""if you're not too busy.""

""No sir,"" says the barman. ""Never too busy."" He pops the top off a dark bottle of rye and pours a generous glass.

The cowboy throws it back, licks his lips, and says, ""My, my, my. Doesn't do any good in the bottle, does it?""

""I suppose it doesn't,"" says the bartender.

The fly buzzes by.

""Well!"" says the cowboy, clearly itching for company. ""Where in the Sam Hell is everybody?""

""Oh,"" says the bartender, ""they're all at the hangin'.""

""Hangin'?

""Hangin'.""

The cowboy motions for another belt of brown, and the bartender obliges.

""Now who might they be hangin' today?""

The bartender puts his rag on his shoulder, looks the cowboy straight in the eye and says, ""Sir, today they're hangin' none other than 'Brown Paper Pete'.""

""Brown Paper Pete?""

""The very same.""

The cowboy points to the now empty glass and makes the international 'just one more' gesture.

""That's an interesting name, isn't it?""

""It does have an air about it, sir.""

""Now why do you suppose they call him that?""

""Well sir,"" says the bartender, ""they call him 'Brown Paper Pete' because he wears a brown paper hat.""

""Does he now?""

""He does.""

""And if it rains?""

""He wears it all the same.""

""My goodness.""

""That ain't the half of it, sir! See, he also wears himself a brown paper shirt.""

""A shirt?""

""And a brown paper tie. Both of which are firmly ensconced in a well-fitted brown paper frock coat. Do you want me to tell you about his pants?""

""I think I have a pretty fair idea,"" says the cowboy. ""Would it be presumptive of me to assume that they are made of brown paper as well?""

""They are indeed. And he has a nice pair of brown paper boots, and a fine set of brown paper socks.""

""It appears,"" says the cowboy, ""that this outlaw's sobriquet is well-earned!""

""Now I don't know what that specifically means, sir. But I'll wager I agree.""

The cowboy sips in silence.

The fly makes another round.

The bartender goes back to polishing the gleaming glass.

""So!"" says the cowboy. ""What are they hangin' him for?""

The bartender puts down the glass, wipes a smudge from the bar, looks up at the cowboy and says,

""Rustlin'."""

It has been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay.

Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed by now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those headaches once a day.

Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Dept. and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.

Yes, mother and dad, I am pregnant. I know how very much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am now taking daily.

I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know that your oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told his father is an important gunbearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you there was no dormitory fire; I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture; I was not in the hospital; I am not pregnant; I am not engaged. I do not have syphillis, and there is no Negro in my life. However, I am getting a D in sociology and an F in science; and I wanted you to see these marks in proper perspective.

Your loving daughter, "

The witch doctor gives him a medicine and says, ""When you're ready to have sex, drink this potion and say, 'one, two, three' to have an erection. When you're finished, say, 'one, two, three, four' to reverse the effects. This only works once, so use it wisely.""

The man takes his wife to a show and a lovely anniversary dinner, then back home where they get ready for their night of passion. He walks into the bedroom, undresses for her, drinks the potion, and says, 'one, two, three'. In a matter of seconds he's the most well-endowed he's ever been. 

His wife says, ""Wow, what a transformation! But what was the 'one, two, three' for?""

17,OtherJokes,"Due to severe overpopulation, God now only allows people who have died terrible deaths to enter Heaven. WAs God waits near a gate, he is approached a man, where God immediately asks him, ""How did you die?"".

The man replied, ""Well you see, I have always suspected that my wife was cheating on me for at least a few years now. I came home one day to my apartment to see her lying naked in bed, and when I looked over to the balcony, I could see someone holding onto the railing. I asked them, 'What the Hell are you doing here?!"", but he wouldn't reply. I immediately knew that my wife was cheating with him on me. So while my wife was sleeping, I walked up to the man and started punching his hands, in order to make him fall off.

But he wouldn't let go.

So I went and grabbed a knife from the kitchen and started cutting off his fingers. He let go of the railing and fell down about twenty five storeys before hitting the ground.

He was still alive.

Still angry, I went to the kitchen once more and dragged a refrigerator towards the balcony. I then threw the refrigerator over the railing, but my hand must have been caught in the handle of the refrigerator, and so I fell as well. And that's how I died.""

God frowned and said, ""Well, I guess that's a pretty terrible way to die. I'll let you in."". He opened the gates and let the man in, before closing them off once more.
Soon afterwards, he was greeted by a second man.

""How did you die?"", God asked. He then realised that the man was deaf, and started moving his hands, communicating in sign language.

The man replied by moving his hands as well, , ""Well, I was doing exercises out on the balcony of my apartment, when suddenly, I slipped and fell. I was lucky enough to grab onto the railing on the floor below mine, and hung on. Suddenly, a man appeared in front of me. He yelled something at me, but I couldn't understand him because I am deaf. Without warning, he quickly began hitting my hands, but I still managed to hang on. He then quickly left and came back again, and then began cutting my fingers off! I couldn't hold on anymore, and let go. I miraculously managed to survive the fall, but I could not move, as I was now paralyzed. A minute later, the man threw a refrigerator and himself off the building, killing me in the process.""

God cringed as he finished listening and moved his hands around, saying ""Jesus Christ, just go through the gate!""

""Thank you."" The gate opened once more, and closed as the deaf man walked through.

Half an hour later, a third man appeared at the gate, and once more, God asked, ""How did you die?""

The man replied, ""Well you see, I was hiding naked inside a refrigerator and . . ."""

One day, just as he's getting to the end of the last beer, he hears a knock at the door. He goes to answer it, and sees a six foot tall grasshopper. Before he can say a word, the grasshopper punches him in the face as hard as he's ever been hit! Floored, he can't respond before the grasshopper leaves.
He decides he'd better be in better shape, so the next day he only gets one six pack. Just as he's finishing the last beer, he hears another knock at the door. He gets up to answer it, a bit more wary this time. Not that it does him any good. The six foot tall grasshopper is there again, and this time hits him twice, each one as hard as he's ever been hit! Again, the grasshopper leaves before he can do anything.
On the third day, he decides he'd better just skip his beer. He's sitting in his living room, stone cold sober, when he hears a knock at the door. He checks his peephole. It's the grasshopper. But he figures this time he hasn't been drinking and he can take him, so he opens the door. Before he can do anything, the grasshopper knocks him down and kicks him until he can't move. Again, the grasshopper leaves when it's done.
Obviously he's in bad shape after that, so he goes in to see his doctor. He describes what's been going on. The doctor nods knowingly, ""Yeah, there's been a pretty nasty bug going around."""

17,OtherJokes,"Another ""guy goes to a monastery"" joke - an oldie but a goodie This is an old one, so apologies if its been here before (I haven't seen it yet, but I don't check /r/jokes every day). I'm a bit bored at the moment, so I've embellished it a bit! enjoy :)

So, this guy is hiking in the Himalayas, as you do, and, as he's hiking up the narrow, rock-strewn paths, he realises that it is getting late, and darkness comes early in the mountains, and he was still some distance from the next town. He starts walking more quickly, but it became dark and he couldn't see much in front of him. Just as the panic was setting in, he rounded a corner and lo, there was a light in the darkness. A monastery, not on any map, appearing, just as it was sorely needed.
The guy thankfully stumbles up to the great door and bangs on it loudly. After a short time, it slowly creaked open to reveal a large, almost jolly, monk with a huge smile on his face. ""Come in, weary traveller"", he says. Wondering how the happy monk knew English, but not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, the traveller thankfully entered the monastery.
""Please join us for dinner,"" the monk said, with that warming and happy smile. ""it will be, as always, a very joyous and happy occasion"".
""Thank you so much"" says the traveller, as he is shown to a room to refresh himself before the meal.

At the meal, held in the large Hall, with all of the monastery's inhabitants together, the traveller is seated as a guest of honour, next to the Abbot himself. Small talk ensues as they partake of the feast set before them.
All of the monks seem very happy and friendly. Our weary traveller is confused (thinking monasteries were supposed to be quiet, dull affairs), but again, doesn't want to ask any awkward questions, and so is happy to go along.
All of a sudden, one of the monks at a lower table stands up and says loudly, ""24!"". The other monks start chuckling, and nodding their heads in agreement. One or two even bang their cups on the table.
Another monk then stands up and says, ""37"". A bit more obvious a reaction this time - the monks chuckle more loudly, a few laughing out loud and more cup-on-table banging. Even the Abbot chuckles to himself.
A third monk, ""65!"". Loud laughter, patting on backs, more cup on table bangings, even a few feet stompings - clearly the monks are having a  good time!
The traveller, however, is as confused as all hell! Just as he was about to ask the Abbot what was going on, the Abbot himself stood up and shouted ""17!"". More laughter, more appreciation, clapping and table banging. The monks were loving it!
The Abbot sat down, and saw the confused look on the traveller's face. ""My son"", he said. ""We love a good laugh, here at the monastery. We tell jokes at dinner time, and we all enjoy each others' company. In fact, we tell the jokes so often, that we ended up just numbering them - it makes it so much easier to just say the number of the joke. Why don't you try it?""

The traveller thinks for a bit and then stands up and shouts out ""45"". More laughter, more feet stomping, nods of appreciation, comments of 'our guest is joining our traditions"" and that sort of thing.
The traveller is quite pleased with the response, and thinks to himself, ""I'll have another go!""
So he stands up and shouts out ""112!!"".
There was a moment of shocked silence, and then a deafening roar as every monk there laughed loudly, banging on the tables, stomping their feet, patting each other on the back, pointing to our traveller in obvious appreciation. Some even wiped tears of laughter from their eyes.
The traveller sat down again next to the Abbot, feeling quite proud of himself and turned to the Abbot saying, ""They liked that one, did they?""
""Oh yes,"" said the Abbot, ""That was a good one - they haven't heard that one before!"""

Finally after riding the camel through the whole desert, the man came to a road. There was a broken down car with three big chested beautiful blondes sitting in it. He went up to them and asked the women if they needed any help. The hottest girl said ,""If you fix our car we will do anything you want!""

17,OtherJokes,"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side is the most common answer, however this answer leaves a great deal of room for interpretation. As noted historian and sociologist Ian Ormwell stated, ""A joke cannot be taken at face value; all jests are subjective in their appearance and impact."" Contrasting this view, the philosopher Ben Hoovian posited, ""All things being equal, a joke must remain in its proper context. A joke with no context is not a joke."" The issue was finally settled by post-modernist Irma J. King, who unequivocally stated, ""It is the nature of humans to analyze, and all literature created should be subject to analysis."" (For a more complete treatment on the subject I strongly recommend reading her seminal book ""6000 Years of Humor and Counting: Humor's influence on Human Civilization."")

As for the original chicken joke, the most common interpretation would be to take the joke at face value: we are dealing with a ""real"" chicken and road. The humor of the joke is based on its simplicity: while most jokes rely on the extraordinary, the humor of this joke is based on the ordinary.

Of course, one does not need to take the joke at face value. The chicken and the road can be viewed metaphorically. What if the chicken is a metaphorical coward, and is a human rather than an avian. The humor is then based not on the randomness of chicken desires, but becomes an example of cowardice and retreat.
Even deeper, the road could be a metaphor for a dividing line, perhaps ""the other side"" is some kind of forbidden knowledge, perhaps even death. The simplicity of the joke reinforces the listener's ignorance; the joke raises more questions than answers. Sadly, we may never know. Obviously, more research is needed as to WHY the chicken crossed the road. But what kind of road is it? What kind of chicken is it? And if ""the other side"" is indeed death, what are the implications for our own existence?

Please review my sources for their veracity. Let me know of any discrepancies so I can further treat the topic with more accuracy."

Suddenly, the boy starts choking, going blue in the face. The father realizes the boy has swallowed the nickels and starts slapping him on the back.

The boy coughs up 2 of the nickels, but keeps choking. Looking at his son, the father is panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed, attractive, and serious looking woman in a blue business suit is reading a newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee.

17,OtherJokes,"The Cheerio Joke On a planet called Cheeriolia, the population is divided into three societal classes: Cheerios are the lower class, Applejacks are in the middle, and Fruit Loops are the wealthy elite. One cannot intermarry between classes, unfortunately, and discrimination is rampant between them. An authoritarian government keeps very close tabs on individual classes and poverty lines criss-cross through big cities. Cheerios are doomed to a certain limit of wealth, Applejacks cannot earn more than Fruit Loops, and Fruit Loops must pay even heavier taxes. Life is difficult, and each class has its own unique complaints with the way they are forced to live.

A Cheerio named Joe worked at a local Wal-Mart as a cashier, a position he had held for years because his boss is a penny-pinching Applejack. One day, he was bagging groceries for a fellow Cheerio when a Fruit Loop walked through the door, frantically darting her eyes around, panting. She ran down a couple isles, found what she was looking for, and hurried to the check-out area. The Fruit Loop had jumped into the same express lane that Joe was manning. Even though the line was moving quickly, it was an especially busy day and there were quite a few people in the queue. She exclaimed,

“Won’t this line move any faster?”

The Cheerio in front of her shook his head and chuckled to himself. The Fruit Loop didn’t notice. She stood with her one item tucked under her arm, glaring at the rest of the line. Five minutes later, she was at the line’s head. Joe looked at her, in awe of her beauty. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful Fruit Loop he had ever seen. His mouth fell open as she said,

“I don’t usually shop here…”

Her pejorative comment had no effect on Joe, who still could not believe his eyes. The Fruit Loop had to snap her fingers in Joe’s face for him to finally take her credit card. She paid and left, but Joe could not stop thinking about her. He resolved to find out who she was and make her fall in love with him. There was only one problem: he was a Cheerio, and she was a Fruit Loop—even if she *did* love him, it was against the law for them to marry. Still, the thought of love and marriage was hopeful, and it occupied his mind for the next two years.

During those next two years, Joe never stopped thinking about the beautiful Fruit Loop. He worked as hard as he could, bought a chin-up bar to hand in the doorway of his tiny apartment, and subscribed to a gym membership. Joe lost some weight, started running in the mornings, and let his beard grow out. One day, much to his surprise, he awoke to a brand-new, hot-pink body that smelled very sweetly of apples. He had made the jump from Cheerio to Applejack! 

That morning, Joe walked through the doors of the Wal-Mart and his co-workers stared at him, with their mouths agape. He continued working as a cashier, but one day the CEO of Wal-Mart fired Joe’s boss and promoted him to manager at the request of his co-workers, who knew his humble nature and diligence would help their local Wal-Mart. He doubled their pay, and even helped stock shelves when he had nothing else to do. 

A few months passed, and Joe still worked out after the workday ended, but he became very lonely. The beautiful Fruit Loop still was all he thought about, so he devoted even more of his time to work and committed himself to physical fitness. In his deluded aspirations, he sought to win the heart of the Fruit Loop without even knowing her name. 

Just as his hope was running low, the same Fruit Loop entered the Wal-Mart, again looking very rushed, and ran down the aisle frantically looking for another item. As she was running around a corner, she ran into Joe, who was carrying a stack of boxes. They collapsed onto the floor. The Fruit Loop began to shout obscenities as Joe helped her up.

“Sorry, miss.”

She sighed.

“No, I’m sorry. I ran into you. I should have been watching.”

“I’m Joe.”

His voice quivered slightly, and he held out his hand.

“Vanessa.”

Joe led Vanessa to the cashiers, where he let his Cheerio employee go on break so he could check Vanessa out. He took a good look at her, and it was as if not a day had passed since he had seen her last. The only difference now was that he was a jacked-up Applejack who felt much closer to winning Vanessa’s heart. She took her item and left once again. Thoughts of marrying Vanessa didn’t leave his mind for three more years.

In those three years, Joe committed every waking moment to physical fitness. He was promoted at work and given authority over all the Wal-Marts in the tri-state area. Joe was still kind to his employees and gave them high salaries, but the economy was booming and he earned quite a bit of money without working very long hours. He attended some formal parties for Wal-Mart executive Fruit Loops and saw they way they lived, so luxuriously. Joe envied it. But all his wishes and hopes relied on his body and what he was made of. He did not lose hope. And one day, much to Joe’s glee, he awoke to a brand-new, sugar-coated, bright blue body. He was finally a Fruit Loop!

That morning, Joe walked from his penthouse flat to the office and, like he usually did, ran up the stairs. All the cubicles were full when he entered, and everyone peered over to get a look at his new body. All the Applejacks in accounting were amazed, all the Applejacks in IT were amazed, and all the Applejacks in administration were amazed. His boss, the Fruit Loop directly under the CEO, took notice quickly and put in a good word with the CFO, who put in an even better word with the CEO. Both thought very highly of Joe and both thought he would make the perfect CEO one day. No-one knew that the CFO was sleeping with the CEO’s wife, however, and when the CEO found out, he delved so deep into alcohol that the board of trustees voted to let him go and replace him with Joe. 

One day, Joe was walking down the street to the office when he passed Vanessa. She had not aged one day in the last three years, and he immediately stopped to reintroduce himself. Vanessa was surprised it was Joe, because she remembered him to be a mere Applejack, but she did remember him nonetheless. He asked her out for some drinks later that night, and she agreed.

Later that night, they met at a bar and got to talking. Joe discovered that Vanessa, despite her goddess-like beauty, had never been married and had only dated a couple other Fruit Loops. He was just as surprised when Vanessa said that she was interested in dating himself. Joe replied with a definite “yes” without hesitation. His dream had come true; now he was to only win her heart. When Joe got home that night, he put himself through the most strenuous workout he had ever done and fell asleep immediately after he had done his last deadlift. 

Vanessa and Joe dated for eight months. Then, one day, on the terrace of his penthouse overlooking the harbor, Joe asked her to marry him. Vanessa screamed “yes!”

Over the next eight years, Joe and Vanessa were faithful to each other. They had three healthy, beautiful children, and Joe continued working as the CEO of Wal-Mart. The company flourished and Joe was able to buy a large mansion out in the country where he hoped to raise his children. He kept the penthouse in the city in case he had to work late, but most of the time he was able to drive home and read his kids their bedtime stories. Vanessa never aged a day, and Joe loved her with all his heart. He had finally fulfilled his dream, and life was good.

One day, Joe was finished with an important meeting and decided to clock out and drive home to surprise his children. He had forgotten what time the school day ended and arrived in the early afternoon at his mansion. A sleek, black sedan was in the driveway, and Joe didn’t know whose it was. He cracked open the front door slowly, and went straight to the bedroom without calling his wife’s name. Joe had a terrible feeling in his stomach. He threw the door to the master bedroom wide open and saw Vanessa in bed with the old CFO. He screamed obscenities at him and threw him out of his house. Vanessa tried to explain that it meant nothing, that she still loved him, but Joe would have none of it. He packed a bag, booked a plane ticket, called the office saying that he was taking a brief leave of absence, and drove to the airport, distraught. 

He boarded a plane destined for Hawai’i and watched as his home grew smaller and smaller in the distance. Joe decided he would stay in Hawai’i for a week to get his head straight and figure out what to do. When the plane arrived the next day, Joe found a five-star hotel right next to the beach. The view was lovely, and every morning before the sun was at its hottest, he would walk along the waves and think about his life. He was troubled, but at the same time he was proud of himself and what he had made of himself. Joe wasn’t sure what to do.

One morning, he passed a young, beautiful woman walking the other way. She was a Fruit Loop, like himself, and though she was not as pretty as Vanessa, she was still breathtaking. Joe stopped, introduced himself, and offered to take her up to a favorite bar by the beach for some fruit juice. The Fruit Loop said her name was Merlot and that she, too, was on vacation. They had a few drinks and talked all afternoon; they told each other their darkest secrets and, by sunset, Joe felt like he knew Merlot better than he had ever known his wife. As the moon was rising, they kissed under the stars, and Joe took Merlot back to his hotel room.

The next day, they both walked along the water. The passed the same bar they had stopped at the day before, and a sign hung in the window: 

“We’re closed for the Juice Festival on 3rd Street.”

The couple was puzzled, so the walked hand in hand to the location the sign specified. A large, frightening bouncer-Applejack stood in the doorway, so Joe gave him a tip and he let them in. The party inside was loud and exciting. Along the far wall, rows and rows of booths surrounded a buffet line. The music playing was so catchy, however, that Merlot dragged Joe onto the dancefloor. Hours passed, and they were soon tired. Looking for a place to sit, the picked a booth. They kissed again. Joe felt like a new breakfast cereal. 

Smells coming from the buffet were so enticing that they had to try a little of everything. They stood in line and chatted up some of the other vacationers who were there for the food and drink. Soon, all the salty food had rendered them both very thirsty. When Joe offered to go find the line for the juice they had seen advertised, he stood between the islands of food and looked around. He didn’t see any juice. There was no punch line."

17,OtherJokes,"Voo-Doo Dick A man about to go on an extended business trip decided to buy his wife a couple of toys as a surprise. He came home the night before his flight out with a sex toy called Voo-Doo Dick.

""Voo-Doo Dick?"" his wife asked. ""What is that?""

""You'll see,"" he smirked. ""Just have fun. It's special.""

The next night, she decides to try it out. The directions read, ""Voo-Doo Dick responds to your every wish! Just say the name twice and then say where you want it to please you. To make it stop, say 'Cid Ood-Oov return,' and Voo-Doo Dick returns to its bed to sleep again.""

She took off her clothes. To test it out, she said, ""Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Dick. My neck."" Voo-Doo Dick began to vibrate and floated to her neck and gave her the best neck message she ever had.

She said, ""Cid Ood-Oov return,"" and Voo-Doo Dick floated back to its box quietly.

She said, ""Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Doo Dick, my breasts."" Voo-Doo Dick once again floated to her and stimulated her nipples until she was turned on more than she had ever been.

After several minutes of that, she said, ""Voo-Doo Dick, Voo-Doo Dick... my pussy."" Voo-Doo Dick moved down from her breasts and began to fuck her better than she had ever been before. She had orgasm after orgasm until she'd had enough.

But she couldn't remember the safe phrase to call off Voo-Doo Dick. She tried looking for the instructions, but she couldn't find the paper and the constant vibrating and intense orgasms still hitting her wouldn't let her think.

Finally, she decided she had to get medical help. Voo-Doo Dick was still going at it. She clumsily put on a robe, got into her car, and headed toward the hospital to try to get it removed.

She weaved back and forth all over the highway as more orgasms overwhelmed her as she drove. A few miles from the hospital, a highway patrol car pulled her over.

""What in the world is going on with you, lady?"" yelled the patrolman when he got to her window. ""You must be drunk, weaving all over the road. All you look damn near naked.""

She explained what happened and that she was going to the hospital for help.

""I've heard some whoppers in my day, lady, but that's the worst lie I've heard yet.""

""But it's true! The Voo-Doo Dick won't stop!""

His daughter was extremely beautiful and has had many men across the world ask for her hand in marriage and her father began seeing which of these men would suit her. After searching for a month, the optometrist had finally narrowed it down to two me who he thought could take care of his daughter.

He owned many large estates around the world that he could go to on his private airlines and owned large shares of giant companies.

How the hell would that work? Plus, it would just be impossibly tedious to build such a thing, even for an all-powerful genie! I'm sorry, but you're just an idiot! Think of something more realistic! HA!""

The man sighed and thought for a while before saying, ""I know what I want. I wish that I could just understand women. I wish I could know what they mean when they say they're fine. I wish I could know what I did to make them mad. I wish I could just know how to please them for once.""

14,OtherJokes,"This is a story of a perfectly married couple. The only friction in their marriage was the husband’s habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn’t stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. 


The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. 


Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn’t listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers, I think I got most of them back in!"""

14,OtherJokes,"Two boys walk into a pet shop. There were two young boys in a pet shop. One named Derek, and his older brother Patrick. They had been given money by their father to buy themselves two animals—one for each of them. There was such a selection! Dogs, cats, caterpillars, giraffes, parrots, and more. They could only afford two of the smaller animals, and so they were browsing the section dedicated to these.

First they looked at the birds. There were parrots. The boys had heard that they could speak, but when they tried to converse with them, the parrots neglected to do so in a way that satisfied the boys.

“Hello, Mr Parrot. How are you doing on this fine afternoon?” asked Derek, enthusiastic about the chance to see such a wonderful creature in action.

The parrot looked at him, and to Derek's disappointment, the parrot said “Fuck off, I'm trying to sleep you dickhead!”

They moved on to the next creature which was the hamster. They watched them running around and fornicating, and as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.

Next was a turtle. Both of the brothers were impressed with the sight of the turtle.

“There is little chance of it running away!” exclaimed Patrick, “we will never lose them!”

The turtle was reading a book, and they were curious to know what it was that the turtle was into.

“I hope it's the Bible!” said Derek, excitedly.

But as they looked at it closer they came to know that it was Harry Potter and as they were close with the Lord, they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.

Beside the cage that the turtle was kept in could be found a chicken. But as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so fowl. 

They searched and searched through the shop and there was nothing that wasn't recklessly rubbing the Lord's face in their own sexual deviance, engagement with the Occult, or being a chicken—the greatest of all sins, committed by several of the pet shop's creatures, including the giraffe. They lamented this fact, for the giraffe appears such an innocent and sweet character! With its whiskers and tail. But alas! As the giraffe is also gravely guilty of “being a chicken,” in the Lord's eyes he is heathen and will perish the wrath of Satan.

They sought out an employee so that they might be freed of their woes. The employee was in the process of cleaning with a broom.

They said to the woman, “Can you help us?”

She turned to them and replied, “Fuck off, I'm trying to sweep you dickhead.”

Then she saw the sadness and pain in their eyes and the love of God touched her heart and she had a change of mind.

She said to the boys “I will help you. What is it that you need?”

Derek asked of her, “Is there any creature in this Pet Shop that is not heathen. Is there one among the animals that does not offend the Lord?”

And understanding the boys' woes she said to them, “Yes, there is one,” and she led them to a small cage containing several beetles.

“Here you will find the weevil.”

And they marvelled at the small but innocent creature and they bought two of them and brought them home.

But their troubles were not over, for they could not tell which one should belong to whom. They decided that as Patrick was the oldest, he had a claim to the greatest of the two of them. But which was the greatest? Only a contest held between the weevils would decide the answer to this most glorious question. And so it began, the world's smallest Olympics; with few events instead of many, with beetles instead of humans, and with only two weevils from the same family, rather than a large portion of humans from many of the nations of Earth.

They decided that before they began the contest, they would name them. One of them would be called “Fermented Bovine Urine” and the other would be “Greg” for these are the names that most please the Lord.

The first contest would determine which of the beetles was superior in strength. It would be a contest of who could lift the most pianos, for the family had many pianos, and lifting pianos would be a feat of strength indeed. The creature that went first would be Greg. Greg lifted one piano and was tired after doing so. But for he was of great determination he lifted a second. And then a third. After this he apologised to the boys and said that there was no more that he could do.

Fermented Bovine Urine went second and it clear from the beginning that he had little capacity to lift any piano whatsoever. He was saddened by his failure and wept, for he was of inferior strength.

The next competition was to determine how each of the weevils was with navigation. So they put each in turn into a maze of the boys' own construction. Greg, once again, was first, and he finished the maze within minutes.

Fermented Bovine Urine was the next contestant and he was less talented with navigation than Greg was, for he could not even make it past the first alligator-pit that had been installed. He wept once more that he was not capable of defeating Greg.

The next would determine their intelligence and so they were each given the same math problem.

“Surely” exclaimed Fermented Bovine Urine, “I can win this competition!”

But whereas Greg managed to provide the correct answer, Fermented Bovine Urine had merely drawn pictures of boobies for half an hour, and numbered them so that the boys might know he can count.

The next competition would determine which of them had greater musical talent. They would both sing a song for the boys, accompanied by their mother on the piano, and the boys would know who could sing with superiority.

Greg chose a piece of opera, and delivered with great competence. His voice was strong, his notes were on-pitch, his technique was at a professional level. Fermented Bovine Urine chose a punk-rock song and was disqualified.

The last and most important test was the competition to see who among the beetles was closest with the Lord. Greg stood up in front of the two boys and with no reference to the Holy Book, recited the entire Bible verbatim.

Fermented Bovine Urine felt the Lord in his heart, but whereas Greg was greatly dedicated to his relationship with Christ, he had spent little time on it. He instead read out select passages from Chad Kroeger's Wikipedia page.

It was now decided. Patrick was to own Greg, the greater of the weevils, and Derek was to own Fermented Bovine Urine. The two boys took each of the creatures to their rooms and put them in their individual cages.

The next day they started to notice a difference in each of their lives which they knew was directly caused by the introduction of the weevils into their homes. Derek, the owner of Fermented Bovine Urine had gone to school that day and had found that whereas in the past people would ignore him, they began to notice him and celebrate his existence. He had become a greatly popular boy at his school. Derek praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.

As the owner of Greg, Patrick's experience at school that day was different. Whereas in the past he had been ignored by his peers, now they would beat the living shit out of him and call him names. Patrick was enraged that his brother had been blessed and he had not, despite him owning the greater of the pets!

He cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you allowed me to suffer this way?”

But the Lord was trolling Atheists on Reddit and did not hear him.

The next day Derek was given a gift by a generous neighbour which was a new bicycle. This bicycle was faster, easier to control and a far smoother ride than any he had ever experienced. He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.

Patrick's current bicycle got run over by a car whilst he was riding it and he was given several cuts and bruises and a completely broken spine.

He cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have I been cursed so?”

But the Lord was browsing Redtube and did not hear him.

A week later Fermented Bovine Urine gave Derek a hug, and Derek was pleased for he knew that his life was filled with love and joy! He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his glory.

Patrick, though he could no longer move, asked Greg for a hug, but the beetle mistook his words and stabbed him with a used needle. He contracted aides, and cancer of the aides and was stoned to death for being a homosexual by the members of his church. 

In his final moments he cried out to the Lord, “Why, God? Why have you blessed my brother so and cursed me when my weevil was greater?”

But though the Lord could hear him, he was disinterested in Patrick and neglected him out of indifference.

You see, my children, there is a moral here. You must always choose the lesser of two weevils."

I had to run to catch up with it for several blocks, I finally caught up and kneeled down to fetch the ring from it's mouth when I looked up and saw the most gorgeous woman I'd ever seen. She thought I was proposing! We had a grand laugh about it over lunch, and almost a month later I proposed to her for real, with that very ring.

When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk.

My wife and I got married last summer, we were together since we were teens, she was the only person that wanted to be with me, and she was the only one I wanted to be with, other than my best friend ofcource , he’s the only other one I’d spend my time with, and it helped that my friend and my then girlfriend ( now wife ) got along very well, in fact she hung out with me because she thought my friend was cute initially ( that’s what she said ( no pun intended, or detected ( parenthesis inception ) ) )

Today, I came home early from a business trip, I did not tell my wife about it, I wanted it to be a secret, I did not tell anyone about it. I wanted to surprise her, I wanted her to know that I cared about her and that I will and will always be there for her … the thing is my wife had nightmares about me being unalive and that she’d be a widow and the only person by her side at my funeral was my friend. 

I decided go to my best friends house, which a stones throw away from mine first, because I had the strangest gut feeling that he would be with my wife that night… Don’t get me wrong I love them both and I love the fact that they get along, but I just couldn’t get the thought out of my head, and when I went over to his … empty house, I had a moment of clarity. I was not mad, I was not angry, I was not enraged, in fact, it was all a seiner blob of thought. All  those times when he’d as us to have dinner together and I’d be the only one who’d say “no”, all those time my wife said he was a cute… 

At this moment, I felt … happy . I was glad , I couldn’t believe myself. I was glad that my best friend cared this deeply about my wife, and I was glad that my wife loved my best friend this much, I was incredebally happy !!  I could now surprise them together in my own bed room !! As I unlocked my house doors, I was careful not to make a sound and wake them up, and as I walked closer to my bed room, I saw two plates in the dining area, and I opened my bed room door as slowly as I could.

I was correct … My best friend was sleeping in the warm embrace of my wife, and it was so … cute, but as I took another step, the floor board creaked and my friend who had a keen ear looked around and saw me. For a moment he did not know what to do, but the very next he jolted towards me; and in the process woke my wife up. When he got close enough, he put his hands on my chest and stared kissing my all over my face, and my wife looked sheepishly at us and fell onto the bed cheekily whilst opening her arms for a hug and said “ I missed you ... “. 

I kissed my friend and went over to my wife and said, “ You know, I knew that you’d be with him, and I love the both of you for that”, while hugging her. My best friend joined in on the hug and I decided at that moment that he’d move in with us and would have dinner with us every night. He was now **our** best friend and the good-est boy we have ever known. We were one big happy family...

tl;dr: The devil is in the detail.

 His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way.

One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business. 

He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business. 

He decided to employ someone to run the shop.

The next day he set up three interviews. 

The first guy was great. 

He knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. 

At the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

And the man replied, “Why, yes, I couldn’t help noticing you have no ears.” 

The rugby player got angry and threw him out.

The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. 

He asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

She replied: “Well, you have no ears.” 

He got upset again and showed her the door.

The third and last interview was with the best of the three. 

He was a very young man fresh out of college. 

He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business.

The rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: “Do you notice anything different about me?”

To his surprise the young man answered: “Yes, you wear contact lenses.”

The former rugby player was shocked, and said, “What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?”

The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears!”"

12,OtherJokes,"The Penguin Collector So, there's this guy. This guy collects penguins. He doesn't collect penguin statues or toys or anything, he collects real, living penguins. Penguins of all sorts, Emperor Penguins, King Penguins, Little Penguins, African Penguins, all the penguins. 

Now, these penguins live all over his house. In his bathtub, sink, toilet, fridge, freezer, penguins everywhere. His house is practically bursting with these penguins.

 The mans wife is obviously not impressed with the amount of penguins her husband has.

""Honey,"" she said to him, ""You have got to get rid of all these penguins. We have no room to live. We can no longer afford to have nice things, not only do the penguins ruin everything we own, but we can hardly afford to feed the penguins. You have to get rid of them.""

""I can't do that!"" The man replied. ""I love these penguins. They are like family to me!""

""Either they go, or I go!"" She stated.

After pondering this ultimatum for a while the man decides that he does, indeed, love his wife more than all his penguins put together. But what to do with all these penguins? 

""Why don't you donate them to the County Zoo?"" His wife asked.

""Great idea! I'll call them tomorrow.""

""Honey, you better call them now. I cannot go one more day with these penguins living here.""

The man, saddened by his failed attempt to keep the penguins at least one more day, begrudgingly picks up the phone.

""Hello, County Zoo, how may I help you?"" Spoke the cheery voice on the phone.

 The man took a deep breath and spoke slowly. 

""Hello, I'd like to speak to the person in charge of accepting donations please.""

The receptionist on the other end of the line could hear the sadness in his voice. 

""I'll connect you right away sir"" 

The phone was silent for a minute. The man hoped that no one would be connected, that perhaps he could have one last day with the penguins.

""Hello, County Zoo donation office. How may I assist you?""

 The man's heart sank ""Hello, I have a very large collection of penguins I would like to donate.""

""Penguins?""

""Yes, penguins.""

""Like, real penguins?""

""Yes, real penguins.""

""That's fantastic!!"" The donation coordinator exclaimed ""We have been trying to get penguins here for a long time! We have an area all set up, but no penguins to live there!""

The man smiled to himself. This person seemed very excited to get these penguins. At least they would be going to a happy home and they wouldn't be too far away so he could go visit. 

""My wife says I need to get rid of them today""

""Fantastic! Come on down anytime, we will be waiting!""

It was settled. The many attached his trailer to his truck and started loading up the penguins. After spending an hour counting the penguins to make sure he had them all the man closed the trailer door and stared to drive to the County Zoo. The man got about halfway there and sure enough he got a flat tire.

""Damn it!!"" The man thought to himself. ""The County Zoo is almost closed, how will I explain to my wife if I come home with all these penguins."" 

It was at that point that the man saw another truck coming down the road. He flagged the truck down.

""Sir you have to help me! I need to get these penguins to the County Zoo. They are about to close soon and my wife will kill me if I don't take these penguins to the County Zoo today.""

""You want me to take these penguins to the County Zoo?"" replied the stranger.

""Yes! Please! I'll pay for you to take them to the County Zoo. How about $500. Is that enough for you to take them?""

The stranger took the money.

""Yeah, that should be enough.""

So the two men loaded up the strangers truck with all the penguins and off the stranger went.

After a while the man finally got his truck fixed and off he went to the County Zoo. When he got there though the County Zoo was closed. The man started banging on the gate and yelling until a security guard showed up.

""What is your problem?"" Scoffed the security guard.

""Please tell me, did my penguins arrive safely, are they all there? May I see them in their new home?"" Pleaded the man.

""Penguins? We were excepting some penguins, but we never got them.""

""WHAT!?!"" The man was furious!! ""That jerk stole all my penguins and my $500 was a rude person!!""

""Sorry, sir.""

The man needed a way to blow off steam. He decided to drive around for a while before going home to his wife.

After, maybe, 30-40 minutes the man sees the stranger from earlier. There he was. Walking down the street with a row of penguins following him, far as the eye can see.

The man slammed on his breaks.

He hopped out of his car.

He approached the stranger and said,

""Hey! Jerk! How dare you! How dare you steal my $500 and not take the penguins to the County Zoo!""

""Oh."" Said the stranger. I already took them to the County Zoo. I had money left over so I was taking them to the movie theatre.""

Slightly confused, the son heads over to the brothel with the duck and meets with one of the women there. The son explained the situation to the lady and told her that even though he has no money, he does have this duck. The woman thinks for a while, and decides to take the duck as payment since she knew a guy that could help her prepare the duck so that she could cook it for dinner.

So after they have sex, the woman is flabbergasted at just how magnificent the son was in bed. She even offered him a freebie but being the polite guy that he is, he refused. So the woman, desperate for another round, offered the duck back as payment, the son agrees and so they have sex again. 
Later, the son leaves the brothel with the duck. On their way back home a truck appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and hits the duck, killing it. Feeling bad, the driver offers to pay the son for the duck. Not knowing how much it was worth the son settles for $20. The driver happily obliges, pays him the $20, and they both go on their ways.

Finally the son gets home when his dad asks him ""So son, how was it?"" The son replies ""I dunno dad, you tell me."" ""Ok, so tell me what happened"" replied the dad. The son replied ""Well dad, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 20 bucks for a fucked up duck."""

His friend urged Charlie to stay over, but since there was neither a spare bed or couch in the house, Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife tapped Charlie on the shoulder, calling him over on her side. They both started whispering:

* Charlie: ""I couldn't do that. Your husband is my best friend!""

* Wife: ""Listen, sugar, there ain't nothing in the whole wide world that could wake him up now.""

* Charlie: ""I can't believe that... Certainly if i get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up, won't he?""

* Wife: ""Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him.""

Charlie did just that, and was amazed when the husband remained asleep, so he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her.

**The ninth time** he pulled a hair, the husband woke up and muttered:

The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.

The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.
The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.

And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides."

11,OtherJokes,"An Irish man, Mr. Halligan, went drinking with his buddies every Friday night... and on this particular Friday night Halligan and the boys decided to have a contest to see who could make the best drinking toast.

They went around the room saying their toasts, when finally it came to Mr. Halligan who thought he may have a winner.

""May we all spend the rest of our lives, between the legs of our wives"" he said.

His friends all agreed that this was the best toast of the night and bought Halligan a round.

Later that night when Mr. Halligan got home he stumbled in the doorway and was immediately confronted by his wife, Mrs. Halligan.

""How was your night drinking with the boys?"" she asked.

""Wonderful,"" he replied, ""we had a contest to see who could make the best toast and I won!""

""Oh what was your toast?"" his wife asked eagerly.

As he was about to tell her, he remembered that Mrs. Halligan was a devout Irish Catholic, and certainly wouldn't approve of the toast he had made. Thinking quick on his feet Mr. Halligan said,

""My toast was, 'May we all spend the rest of our lives, in church with our wives'"".

Mrs. Halligan was elated that Mr. Halligan and his friends voted such a pleasant toast as the best of the night, and kissed him as she went off to bed.

The following day, Mrs. Halligan was at the grocery store and ran into one of her husbands drinking buddies, Mr. O'Doyle.

""Mr. O'Doyle, how great it is to see you. I just wanted to say how wonderful I think it is that you all voted my husbands toast as the best of the night. What a pleasant thought that was.""

Mr. O'Doyle had a very confused look on his face, because he knew Mrs. Halligan quite well and knew that she was a devout Irish Catholic. He never would have thought she would like a toast like that.

""Really?"" he asked. ""You really like THAT toast?""

""Of course I did!"" she exclaimed. ""The only strange this is that Mr. Halligan has only been down there twice this year. The first time he fell asleep halfway through, and the second him I practically had to stick my foot up his butt just to get him to come!"""

11,OtherJokes,"A group of bureaucrats from the EU are out on a chartered luxury liner through the Pacific. A storm blows up, the cruiser starts to sink, and everyone abandons ship. By a quirk of fate, the only survivors are two men and one woman from each of the EU countries. They stagger onto the shore of a beautiful desert island. After three months, things have changed.

One Italian man has killed the other Italian man in a fight over the Italian woman.

The two Frenchmen and the French woman are enjoying a threesome, but complain bitterly about the multitude of foreigners on their island.

The two Englishmen are waiting patiently for someone to introduce them to the English woman.

The German men have a strict, weekly alternating sex schedule; the woman gets weekends off.

The Dutch men are fully prepared, in general, to share the woman. However, they are still debating how to ensure that both will have an exactly equal share, how to reduce supervision cost, and how to guarantee the woman equal rights. They are writing to the Hague.

The Luxemburg men are still recovering from the shock of seeing half the population of Luxembourg stranded on the island. But they will soon start collecting seashells on the beach.

The Finnish men took one look at the endless ocean, one look at the Finnish woman, and started swimming.

They were soon overtaken by the Portuguese men.

The Danish trio embarked on a search for people to join them in an orgy. They gladly accepted the participation of the Finnish woman, and are still vainly trying to persuade the Portuguese woman.

The Spanish men are protecting the virginity of the Spanish woman and are constantly suspiciously spying on one another. Meanwhile, she dances flamenco.

The Austrian men initiated a yodelling contest for the woman. The loser immediately started learning flamenco, as well as Portuguese, Finnish and Danish.

The Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.

The Swedish woman keeps on bitching about female exploitation while the men are sunbathing and waiting for her to tell them what to do.

The Irish began by setting up a distillery for which they expect to receive a substantial EU subsidy. They don't recall if sex is in the picture, because it gets sort of foggy after the first few rounds of coconut whisky. But they're happy that, at least, the English aren't getting any.

The only thing they wanted was a little grape to call their own. They tried and tried for weeks, making intimate grape love everynight with no success. One night they decided to take a break and go visit the circus that just pulled into the vineyard.  
  
The circus was amazing and they enjoyed a peaceful night not worrying about babies, as they were leaving they noticed a small tent off to the side and they entered it. An old wrinkly prune sat in front of a table and spoke to them ""I know what you seek, a child to call your own, I can help you but it comes at a price."" ""Anything"" Mrs Grape replied ""we have money, antiques, anything!"" ""No, no, no, drink this potion, in 6 nights you will give birth. He will not be handsome, he will not be timid, if you can not love him, you will return to us and he will live here in the circus, yes?"" The prune asked as she handed a small bottle to Mrs Grape. Knowing she would love him no matter what he was like, Mrs Grape drank the potion.  
 
True to the prunes word Mrs Grape fell pregnant, six nights later she gave birth, he was small, very dry, brown and shrivelled. Mr & Mrs Grape tried to care for the little boy, they nurtured him, stayed awake with him, gave him everything they had but he never stopped crying and once he could move he never stopped trying to destroy their house. After several weeks they were exhausted. The little one never grew, he stayed dry, small and wrinkly, the stress was becoming too much.  
  
One day Mr Grape returned from work with a small cage, he convinced Mrs Grape they needed a nights sleep and to decide in the morning if they would return the child to the circus. They locked him in the cage and moved him to the furthest part of the vineyard. For the first time in weeks they held each other and slept. In the morning with a fresh outlook they knew something was not right with their child, they walked hand in hand to the cage, ready to take him to the Prune.  
  
Mr Grape spoke sadly ""I'm sorry buddy, we've tried, we are exhausted and I don't even think you understand us? We've given it our all but we are taking you to live with the circus. You're just not the child we planned on *raisin*."

Hi Bob, This is Alan next door.
I have a confession to make. I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling you in text as I can't live with myself a moment longer without you knowing.
The truth is I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. In fact, probably more than you. I haven't been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse, I know.
The temptation was just too much. I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. It won't happen again.
Please suggest a fee for usage, and I'll pay you.
Regards, Alan.

THE ACTIONS
Bob, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, and shot his neighbor dead. He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. He took out his phone where he saw he has a subsequent message from his neighbor:

THE SECOND MESSAGE
Hi Bob, This is Alan next door again. Sorry about the typo on my last text.

And believe it or not, he says, without waiting for me to respond. Her mom was watching!

Around midnight, he was snapped our of his thoughts when someone in the cellblock yelled ""TWELVE!"". Then, there was the sound of laughter reverberating around the building. He looked over to his cellmate who was laughing as well. Jim was surprised, but didn't make much of it. 

A little later, there was a shout of ""TWENTY NINE!""! Again, the inmates in the block started to hoot in delight. Jim was intrigued and asked his cellmate, who was doubled over laughing, just what the heck was going on with the numbers.

We numbered them so that they're easier to tell! You can shout out a number, and every inmate in this building will know what joke you're talking about!""
